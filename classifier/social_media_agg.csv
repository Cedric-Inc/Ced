reddit,a,The actual infinite money glitch,"Everybody thinks Michael Sailor found the infinite money glitch with his Strategy stock options. But there is another insane market out there where Exchanges can conjure up random tokens out of the blue and make people fight for it. Yes, I am talking about the Futures Market. Exchanges don't really have to send or receive tokens/cryptocurrencies to make gorrillion amount of money. Just create a random pair with USDT and have people opening long and short positions on it. While they take the fees. It's basically creating nothing and get people to pay you for speculating on this nothing. 

  
Anyone here wonder what moves the bitcoin market? Go look into the futures/derivatives market. Also if anyone is able to figure out how exchanges are able to sustain bitcoin future trading with billions upon billions of trade orders despite having bitcoin supply being at the lowest, do let me know ",2025-07-07 10:36:56+00:00
reddit,s,Practicalities/Cons for Income,"TL;DR: I make something nice. People can spend me money for support. What currency/ies should I use?

I have started working on a project.
Because of I consider piracy to be moral, I have no double standars and make my thing freely available.
I will give the option to spend me money, though (and potentially to opt in advertisement).
I don't want that people know who is behind the project ‚Äì partly to make it more mysterious, partly because I will likely be breaking some national laws.

I'm realistic here: I'm not sure whether I will gain even a single penny. I'm just doing it as a side hustle, for fun, no expectations, just for the sake of doing it. Though eventually earning  10 or 15 dollars a month as a passive is not unrealistic either.

Though technically speaking, with an arbitrarily small probability I can get arbitrarily rich.
But because most likely the income will be minescule, I'm going to stockpile the income until it reaches some worthy amount.

With that being said, I want to use a crypto currency such that

1) As many people as possible will be willing to spend me some money
2) It is either stable or will likely have a slight deflation over the next (few) decade(s)
3) I can be sure that no one will be able/willing to track me down

If you recommend me one currency over another, please explain the pros and cons that lead to that conclusion.

And even more importantly:
What is the best way to gain the knowledge about these topics myself?
Where are reliable resources I can gain information from?
How can I verify the validity and degree of certainty of your recommendations?
Etc.

I am new to crypto and investment in general and I wanted to know that if you have $100 to invest right now in 2025.

How would you split it? Would you go all-in on a single crypto? Or would you be allocating in different coins. Also, would you be going for the major coins like eth and btc or would you be going with alt coins?

What would your decision be and why?

I'm curious to hear different strategies that you might have for investment, whether you would be going for long term investment or would you go for  high risk and high reward type of investment.

reddit,s,Ergo 6.0 soft fork has been supported.,"üö® ERGO 6.0 IS ALMOST HERE ‚Äî A LANDMARK IN DECENTRALIZED ENGINEERING üö®

#ERGO $ERG

After two years of meticulous development, testing, and coordination, the Ergo 6.0 soft fork is officially activating on mainnet ‚Äî with over 92.97% of miners signaling support.

This isn‚Äôt just a routine upgrade.
This is a paradigm shift for Proof-of-Work blockchains.

üîì What Ergo 6.0 Unlocks:

üß† Sub-Second Block Intervals

‚Ä¢Thanks to architectural changes, Ergo can now process blocks in fractions of a second ‚Äî dramatically improving throughput and responsiveness without sacrificing decentralization.

üîó Sigmachains

‚Ä¢One of the most groundbreaking innovations in blockchain tech: Sigmachains enable parallel execution chains secured by Ergo‚Äôs PoW Layer-1.

‚Ä¢This unlocks scalability, app-specific chains, and new design possibilities ‚Äî all without resorting to PoS or rollups.

üåç Decentralized Mining via @LithosProtocol

‚Ä¢Ergo 6.0 lays the foundation for Lithos, a decentralized mining pool protocol.
‚Ä¢This removes reliance on centralized mining pools and promotes true miner sovereignty.

üîê Stronger Layer-1 Privacy + Security

‚Ä¢Enhancements to ErgoScript, Sigma protocols, and oracle infrastructure give developers more power to build secure, expressive, and private smart contracts ‚Äî without sacrificing auditability.

üß± Backward Compatibility + Layered Evolution

‚Ä¢This is a soft fork ‚Äî no chain splits, no centralized control. Just a network of aligned nodes and miners steadily improving the protocol together.

‚∏ª

üí¨ Why This Matters:

In a world dominated by centralized VC-backed chains and inefficient Layer-2 workarounds, Ergo stands apart:
‚Ä¢No pre-mine
‚Ä¢No ICO
‚Ä¢No corporate steering
‚Ä¢Just brilliant open-source engineering and true decentralization

Ergo 6.0 is proof that Proof-of-Work can evolve ‚Äî and scale.

Let the world watch.
PoW is not dead. It‚Äôs reborn. On Ergo.

Also yesterday Ergo had an emission reduction from 15 to 12 ergo per block.",2025-07-07 04:21:11+00:00
reddit,s,Does this intense froth worry you?,"in the 1980‚Äôs we had a saying ‚ÄúWhen the shoe shine boy gives you a stock tip get out of the market.‚Äù The market crashed, hard, in 1987. Right before that the froth was insane, grandmothers were telling to to buy specific stocks.

Im seeing that same degree of froth today with Bitcoin. Probably worse.

EVERYONE is talking about it. People in Reddit asking if they should take personal loans, mortgage their house and even foregoing a home purchase in lieu of BTC. It‚Äôs literally EVERYWHERE.

And then we have Michael Saylor. It seems that he just pulls predictions out of his ass with each one more outrageous than the last. This week it was ‚ÄúThe most important number is 21. 21 Million in 21 years.‚Äù

The one reason why I‚Äôm holding my respectable position is because Trump media just raised $2.5 billion to buy BTC. I figure there‚Äôs no way he‚Äôs going to allow a loss and one or two right words from him, which I‚Äôm confident he‚Äôll do, and it‚Äôs off to the races.

banknews,s,300% Increase In American Investors Defrauded By 'Pump'n'Dump' Stock Fraud: FBI,"300% Increase In American Investors Defrauded By 'Pump'n'Dump' Stock Fraud: FBI Authored by Naveen Athrappully via The Epoch Times,There has been a surge of criminals targeting stock investors in the United States in a ‚Äúramp-and-dump‚Äù stock manipulation scheme via messaging apps and social media platforms, the FBI said in a July 3 alert.In the scheme, ‚Äúinvestment clubs‚Äù are promoted among potential targets. These clubs are often bots or fake accounts, and the promotional messaging directs victims to secure messaging apps where the group operates. Scammers impersonate legitimate brokerage firms or well-known stock analysts to appear credible.‚ÄúThey secretly control a large volume of a low-priced stock and coordinate efforts to inflate its price (‚Äòramp up‚Äô) by encouraging investment club members to purchase shares over a period of several weeks or months,‚Äù said the alert.‚ÄúOnce the price is artificially elevated, the criminals sell off (‚Äòdump‚Äô) their shares at a profit, leaving unsuspecting investors with significant losses as the stock value collapses.‚ÄùAccording to the FBI, there has been at least a 300 percent annual jump in victims complaining about ramp-and-dump stock fraud so far this year.The agency asked investors who suspect they‚Äôve been duped in investment fraud to report the incident to the FBI Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) website.The FBI‚Äôs Chicago Division released a statement earlier this year seeking victim information on a ramp-and-dump investment scheme.In January, some individuals allegedly impersonated U.S. investment advisors, making ‚Äúfalse representations and instructed investors to purchase shares of CLEU stock, promising significant returns on their investment.‚Äù CLEU refers to China Liberal Education Holdings Limited.‚ÄúHowever, when the value of CLEU stock dropped dramatically on January 30, many investors lost nearly all of the funds invested in these shares,‚Äù the FBI statement said.Warning Signs of FraudIn the FBI alert, the agency detailed some of the red flags to watch out for to identify whether an investment proposal is part of a ramp-and-dump scheme.For instance, people targeted by scammers could receive unsolicited investment tips via ‚Äúaccidental‚Äù messages with links to online investment clubs.The scammers may push to buy low-priced stocks in emerging or new companies, promising high returns, and even vowing to cover losses incurred from investing in these entities, said the alert.They can pressure people to quickly buy stocks, citing a major market-moving event such as government approval or a company breakthrough, it added.‚ÄúIf anyone requests your personal information, access to your financial account(s), or offers a financial benefit in exchange for sharing your information or opening an account, consider this a red flag; your information could be used to open an account through which another party can engage in manipulative activity,‚Äù said the FBI.According to the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), a self-regulatory organization of broker-dealers, one of the hallmarks of a ramp-and-dump scheme it has observed is ‚Äúsignificant, unusual price increases‚Äù on small-cap stocks on the day, or shortly after, their IPOs.Most of these involve companies having operations outside the United States, said the organization, adding that U.S. regulators believe ramp-and-dump schemes were involved in manipulating some of these IPOs.FINRA cited stocks having small market capitalization and limited public float‚Äîthe shares of a company available for trade to the public‚Äîas a red flag of ramp-and-dump fraud.‚ÄúThese schemes have been more commonly found in relation to IPOs raising less than $25 million and issuing fewer than 20 million shares, with issuer valuations under $100 million,‚Äù FINRA said.‚ÄúLimited public float means that only a small portion of overall shares is available to the public. When a company has limited public float, its shares can be more volatile and harder for investors to sell.‚Äù Tyler DurdenSun, 07/06/2025 - 18:40",2025-07-06 22:40:00+00:00

The AI semiconductor startup is looking to take advantage of rising demand for AI services in Europe following other U.S. companies also ramping up investment in the region. Groq, which is backed by investment arms of Samsung and Cisco, said the data center will be in Helsinki, Finland.Artificial intelligence semiconductor startup Groq announced Monday it has established its first data center in Europe as it steps up its international expansion.Groq, which is backed by investment arms of Samsung and Cisco, said the data center will be located in Helsinki, Finland and is in partnership with Equinix.Groq is looking to take advantage of rising demand for AI services in Europe following other U.S. firms which have also ramped up investment in the region. The Nordics in particular is a popular location for the data facilities as the region has easy access to renewable energy and cooler climates. Last month, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang was in Europe and signed several infrastructure deals, including data centers.Groq, which is valued at $2.8 billion, designs a chip that the company calls a language processing unit (LPU). It is designed for inferencing rather training. Inferencing is when a pre-trained AI model interprets live data to come up with a result, much like the answers that are produced by popular chatbots.While Nvidia has a stranglehold on the chips required for training huge AI models with its graphics processing units (GPUs), there is a swathe of startups hoping to take a slice of the pie when it comes to inferencing. SambaNova; Ampere, a company SoftBank is in the process of purchasing; Cerebras and Fractile, are all looking to join the AI inference race.European politicians have been pushing the notion of sovereign AI ‚Äî where data centers must be located in the region. Data centers that are located closer to users also help improve the speed of services.Global data center builder Equinix connects different cloud providers together, such as Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud, making it easier for businesses to have multiple vendors.

banknews,s,This Chinese jeweler is using traditional techniques to challenge Cartier ‚Äî and it's starting in Singapore,"Trump‚Äôs announcement came as the BRICS bloc of developing countries is meeting in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The bloc‚Äôs leaders took aim at Trump‚Äôs sweeping tariff policies in a joint statement over the weekend. The U.S. tariffs announced in April will take effect on Aug. 1, instead of July 9, for countries that have not reached a deal with Washington.U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened an additional 10% tariff on countries that orient themselves along the ‚ÄúAnti-American policies of BRICS.‚ÄùTrump‚Äôs announcement, which did not elaborate on any specific policy of BRICS, came as the group‚Äôs meeting is underway in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.The bloc‚Äôs leaders appeared to take aim at Trump‚Äôs sweeping tariff policies in a joint statement on Sunday, warning against ‚Äúunjustified unilateral protectionist measures, including the indiscriminate increase of reciprocal tariffs.‚ÄùWithout calling out the U.S., the leaders voiced ‚Äúserious concerns about the rise of unilateral tariff and non-tariff measures which distort trade and are inconsistent with WTO rules,‚Äù warning that the ‚Äúproliferation of trade-restrictive actions‚Äù threaten to disrupt the global economy and worsen the existing economic disparities.‚ÄúAny Country aligning themselves with the Anti-American policies of BRICS, will be charged an ADDITIONAL 10% Tariff. There will be no exceptions to this policy,‚Äù Trump said in a post on Truth Social Sunday evening stateside.Trump could have been provoked by the BRICS leaders‚Äô joint statement taking a thinly veiled swipe at his tariff policies, said Stephen Olson, former U.S. trade negotiator and current visiting senior fellow at the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute.By ‚Äúanti-American‚Äù policies, the president may be referring to ‚Äúthe desire expressed by BRICS members to move beyond a U.S.-led world order in finance and global governance,‚Äù said Olson, adding that how that alignment will be assessed was ‚Äúanyone‚Äôs guess.‚ÄùThis year‚Äôs BRICS host country Brazil did not respond to CNBC‚Äôs request for comments.The BRICS group of developing nations also offered symbolic backing to fellow member, Iran, condemning a series of military strikes on the country, without naming Israel or the U.S which carried out the military operation.The bloc includes Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, United Arab Emirates, Ethiopia, Indonesia and Iran. The grouping describes itself as ‚Äúa political and diplomatic coordination forum for countries from the Global South and for coordination in the most diverse areas.‚ÄùThe bloc seeks to challenge Western-dominated institutions of global economic governance, as well as to supplant the U.S. dollar‚Äôs role in the global economy, according to the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.This year, Chinese President Xi Jinping sent Premier Li Qiang to the BRICS meeting in his absence, while Russian President Vladimir Putin, who faces an arrest warrant from the International Criminal Court, attended online.In response to Trump‚Äôs threat of 10% extra duty, a spokesperson for Chinese foreign ministry said at a regular press briefing Monday that China opposed any action of using tariffs as ‚Äúa tool to coerce others.‚Äù‚ÄúChina has been consistent in opposing any tariff war, trade war,‚Äù the spokesperson said, adding that ‚Äúarbitrarily slapping tariffs does not serve the interests of any party.‚Äù That‚Äôs according to CNBC‚Äôs translation of her comments in Mandarin.Separately, Trump confirmed that the U.S. will start delivering letters on Monday, detailing country-specific tariff rates and any agreements reached with various trading partners. That affirmed Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent‚Äôs comments over the weekend.The Trump administration has said that tariffs announced in April will take effect on Aug. 1, instead of July 9, for countries that have not reached an agreement with the U.S.Bessent rejected the idea that Aug. 1 was yet another new tariff deadline. ‚ÄúWe are saying this is when it‚Äôs happening, if you want to speed things up, have at it, if you want to go back to the old rate that‚Äôs your choice,‚Äù Bessent said Sunday on CNN‚Äôs ‚ÄúState of the Union.‚ÄùIn April, Trump announced a 90-day pause on the steep tariffs he had unveiled just days prior on most trading partners. That pause is due to expire on Wednesday, sparking concern among investors and U.S. trading partners.‚Äî CNBC‚Äôs Erin Doherty, Lim Hui Jie contributed to this story.",2025-07-07 00:01:28+00:00

reddit,ltc,Altcoin Rally and Altseason Signals,"[Chart showing BTC\/USDT](https://preview.redd.it/dt68cslma5cf1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=fd87a01908addf934ee0739d749c95a788ab8ea5)

As Bitcoin breaks its all-time high again and Ethereum begins to show meaningful rebound trends, the market's focus naturally shifts to the anticipation of whether the altcoin market will now catch fire. However, one must remember that the market's structure operates in contexts beyond mere price rises. The phenomenon known as altseason is not defined by a few specific coins rising; the key lies in how funds flow and how market participants interpret that flow. The current phase seems closer to a period of checking the potential for a shift in capital rotation rather than a short-term rally.

¬†¬†

# Understanding Bitcoin Dominance as an Altcoin Rally Signal

¬†

[Chart showing Bitcoin Dominace](https://preview.redd.it/aazyf58qa5cf1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=0eb779ebd45319266c2e76f8bc3231b05e3e06b7)

¬†

The first criterion for judging market structure is Bitcoin dominance. This indicator distinguishes whether liquidity entering the market is staying solely in Bitcoin or gradually moving to Ethereum and altcoins. A true altseason occurs when funds progressively flow from Bitcoin to Ethereum and then to mid- and small-cap altcoins.

If Bitcoin's dominance forms a peak and turns downward, it can be interpreted as a signal that funds seeking higher returns are starting to move to other sectors. Recently, despite Bitcoin's new highs, dominance has been stagnating or slightly declining, which appears to be a turning point worth watching closely. If this trend persists, it's hard to ignore the possibility that the market's balance is tilting toward altcoins.

¬†

# The Role of ETH/BTC Ratio in Altseason Signals

¬†

[Chart showing ETH\/BTC](https://preview.redd.it/y854kmzva5cf1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=338d35e096bce3d26ee605999cef06bf53db2ade)

¬†

In the same vein, the ETH/BTC ratio plays a crucial role. The real starting point of altseason has always coincided with the rise of this ratio. When Ethereum begins to show strength against Bitcoin, the market accepts it as a signal of structural recovery. This is not just because of its position as the second-largest by market cap, but because Ethereum serves as a central hub connecting DeFi, L2, NFT, and infrastructure ecosystems. Ethereum's strength implies more than just price; it suggests the recovery of demand across the entire alt market.

If the ETH/BTC ratio consolidates at the bottom and continues its rebound, it could be seen as a clear 'first confirmation signal,' providing investors with reason to reassess their altcoin portfolios.

¬†

# Broader Market Factors Influencing Altcoin Rallies

That said, it's still too early to draw firm conclusions. While funds concentrating in some thematic altcoins are detectable, it's hard to view this as spreading to the entire market. For instance, the recent rises in tokens related to AI, RWA, and DePIN are closer to localized rallies driven by specific narratives rather than a broad alt market uptrend. For an environment worthy of being called altseason to form, widespread concurrent rises must appear across Ethereum-based projects, neglected mid- and small-cap chains, various L1 and L2 ecosystems, and thematic DeFi and NFT projects. Particularly, without accompanying recovery in trading volume and on-chain metrics, the market is unlikely to sustain on short-term expectations alone‚Äîa critical perspective is needed here. These indicators serve as keys to gauging market health, steering away from fixation on mere price fluctuations.

Moreover, altseason has always emerged in market cycles after Bitcoin's stable rally. In phases where Bitcoin repeats sharp ups and downs, funds seek stability, which acts as poison to the alt market. Conversely, when BTC stabilizes at a certain high or enters a sideways phase, market participants then turn to risk assets for greater returns, and that's when the altcoin market starts to stir. **The current situation being merely the 'initial stage of fund movement' suggests that excessive optimism should be guarded against.**

¬†

# External Economic Triggers Like US Rate Cuts

¬†

[Fed Rate Cut Probabilities from CME FedWatch Tool: Essential Signals for Anticipating Altcoin Rally in H2 2025](https://preview.redd.it/vzyaq610b5cf1.png?width=1382&format=png&auto=webp&s=2ddfe4135c1da0757d53483a0dd29cf7f5e82521)

¬†

If expectations of U.S. interest rate cuts, signs of liquidity re-expansion, and tech stock-led stock market rises align, a full-fledged risk-on flow could form in the cryptocurrency market as well. In such a case, funds are likely to flow sequentially beyond Bitcoin to ETH and the entire altcoin market. **Especially, with institutional funds accessing the market through various channels like stablecoins and BlackRock ETFs, the current flow creates an environment where altseason can be designed on a foundation entirely different from the past**. While these external factors can promote structural changes in the market, considering that their effects may not be immediate calls for flexibility in investment strategies.

Bitcoin's current movements are not significant on the surface. Amid fluctuations of around 2%, it even shows patterns of digesting selling volume in a box range retest phase. Observing whether small buys are gradually entering in this range or if selling resumes at resistance levels is more important. Real bull markets often create vertical rises without giving time to buy. If the market is giving time for many to ponder support and resistance and worry about corrections, it also means it's still early. In other words, it's not too late. Rather, if meaningful corrections emerge in this process, that point could become a buying opportunity. Strategies focusing on accumulating spot positions in major coins like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and Ripple remain valid. Full-fledged rallies usually start not after people's convictions form, but while doubts linger.

While Bitcoin shows volatility of 1-3% per day, opportunities are more frequently observed on the altcoin side. Especially since the overall market hasn't entered an overheated phase on a spot basis, strategies to accumulate positions in such phases may be reasonable. More important than short-term fluctuations is where funds are residing and in which direction they are moving. This could be the starting point of that transition.

¬†

[Chart of the Altcoin Season Index](https://preview.redd.it/76b8u665b5cf1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=75411e89903e8db99b9a9453cd790560bf48084b)

¬†

Of course, the futures market now offers environments for significant profits. But looking back at past flows, in phases where bull markets fully materialize, investors maintaining consistent spot portfolios often recorded higher returns. Short-term trading is a means to maximize momentary profits, but when the market starts riding a structural uptrend, long-term holding strategies can work more advantageously. This is even more so in phases where market vitality is reviving like now.

Particularly, fixating on daily charts, immersing in daily market updates on cafes or communities, or relying on overly amplified macroeconomic analyses to time buys often leads to getting caught in FOMO psychology. But the market doesn't wait for such interpretations or predictions. Directions don't change immediately just because rates rise slightly or inflation stabilizes somewhat, and in fact, Bitcoin has broken new highs amid such debates. This approach may seem analytical on the surface, but in reality, it tends to lead to fixation on instant profits, pushing oneself into increasingly unstable states. Above all, even when the market starts to grasp a full direction at crucial points, most are not prepared to ride that flow.

A single trading mistake can damage an account, or conversely, missing one opportunity can leave one watching the entire bull market from the sidelines. Given that the current market environment favors structural and long-term strategies more, taking such risks seems unwarranted. Reflecting back, investors who consistently held spot or some futures from April onward would now be in sufficient profit zones. The likelihood is high that this yielded far better results than repeated frantic trading daily. Ultimately, attempts to time the market often lead to frequent failures, **whereas those riding structural uptrends gain the effects of compounding through time and direction. Approaches that are not sustainable or recoverable can become causes for pushing oneself out of the market even in bull phases.**

¬†

¬†

For some, this phase may be a time to prepare for new opportunities, while for others, it could be interpreted as a section to trim positions or reduce risks. But what's important is clearly establishing one's strategy and building a portfolio accordingly. While it's not yet possible to assert what flow's starting point this is, it seems sufficient timing as preparation to close out the fourth quarter of this year with meaningful profits. Approach it with a strategic perspective, without being too hasty but without missing the flow.

banknews,trump,Trump's ‚Äòbig beautiful' bill locks in key tax breaks for homeowners‚Äîhere's what to know,"Delta Air Lines‚Äô third-quarter earnings and revenue forecasts topped estimates. CEO Ed Bastian told CNBC that bookings have stabilized after months of lower-than-expected demand. But Delta expects 2025 adjusted earnings of between $5.25 and $6.25 a share, down from a January forecast of more than $7.35 a share.Delta Air Lines reinstated its 2025 profit outlook Thursday and said it expects a stronger summer travel season than Wall Street anticipated.Bookings have stabilized after a drop in demand earlier this year, CEO Ed Bastian said in an interview, though at lower levels than the airline forecast at the start of the 2025.Delta shares rose 11%. Shares in other airlines, which report results later this month, also rose after Delta‚Äôs report.Delta expects adjusted full-year earnings of $5.25 to $6.25 a share, down from a forecast in January of more than $7.35 a share, when Bastian predicted 2025 would be the carrier‚Äôs best year ever.In April, Delta said it couldn‚Äôt reaffirm that forecast as on-again, off-again tariffs and hesitant consumers dented bookings. Rival U.S. carriers also pulled their guidance, and Delta and other airlines have announced plans to cut flights after the summer peak. Bastian said the passage of the tax and spending bill and the Trump administration rolling out more trade deals with ‚Äúless rhetoric and more action‚Äù are giving customers more clarity and confidence.‚ÄúPeople are still traveling,‚Äù Bastian said. ‚ÄúWhat they‚Äôve done is they‚Äôve shifted their booking patterns a little bit. They‚Äôre holding off making plans until they‚Äôre a little closer in to their travel dates. And so that‚Äôs shifted some of our bookings and yield management strategies.‚ÄùThat includes trimming capacity outside of top travel periods, as well as what Bastian described as ‚Äúsurgical‚Äù cuts after the peak summer travel season ends around mid-August.Here‚Äôs how the company performed in the three months ended June 30, compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on consensus estimates from LSEG: Earnings per share: $2.10 adjusted vs. $2.05 expected Revenue: $15.51 billion adjusted vs. $15.48 billion expectedDelta, the first of the U.S. airlines to report results for the three months ended June 30, expects adjusted earnings per share of between $1.25 and $1.75 in the third quarter, compared with Wall Street analysts‚Äô forecast for $1.31 a share. It also said it expects revenue that‚Äôs flat to up 4%, topping forecasts for a 1.4% sales increase.Delta posted strong growth from sales of higher-priced seats like first class and from its lucrative American Express partnership, which increased 10% in the second quarter from the same period last year to $2 billion. Airlines have become more reliant on travelers who are willing to spend more to fly rather than more price-sensitive consumers. Airport lounges, Europe and premium class are on the table, Southwest CEO saysTrump wants to bring manufacturing jobs back. The aviation industry can‚Äôt hire fast enoughWhy it‚Äôs getting even harder to get into airport loungesRecession in Row 33: Plane tickets are getting cheaper as domestic travel demand weakensCorporate travel has also stabilized as Bastian said businesses have more clarity and confidence than they did earlier this year, but it‚Äôs in line with last year, not the 5% to 10% growth Delta expected at the start of the year.While fares have dropped across the U.S., Delta‚Äôs premium-product revenue rose 5%, as sales from the main cabin fell 5% from last year. Its total revenue per seat mile, a measure of how much an airline is bringing in for the amount it flies, fell 4% in the second quarter.Bastian said Delta is prepared to continue updating its premium products.‚ÄúWhether it‚Äôs the Delta lounges or the quality of the product on board, the premium products have had life cycles ... and what we thought was state of the art six or seven years ago no longer is,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre continuing to upgrade and update it.‚ÄùDelta has been working for years to tamp down overcrowding and long lines at Delta‚Äôs popular airport Sky Clubs by building larger lounges and spaces dedicated to its top-tier Delta One cabin travelers, as well as with visit limits and other policies.Delta‚Äôs president, Glen Hauenstein, said the airline expects to have ‚Äúalmost all‚Äù of the crowding problems resolved in the next 18 to 24 months, though he noted that one challenge is that bad weather like thunderstorms that can spark hourslong delays.‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt build a club big enough for lengthy delays,‚Äù he said on an earnings call with analysts. ‚ÄúSo I think we‚Äôre trying to look at alternatives that we can use as overflow in those instances.‚ÄùHauenstein reiterated that more customers are choosing to take European vacations after the traditional peak summer months to avoid heat waves, crowds and high hotel rates.In the second quarter, Delta posted adjusted revenue of nearly $15.51 billion, up 1% from a year ago. Its net income in the three months ended June 30 totaled $2.13 billion, or $3.27 a share, up 63% on the year. That compares with net income of $1.3 billion, or $2.01 a share, in the same period last year. Adjusting for one-time items, its per-share net income was $1.37 billion, or $2.10 a share.

Backed by¬†Eric Schmidt¬†(ex-Google CEO), built by ex-Nano devs, and designed to¬†kill SWIFT.

üîç What is Keeta?
Keeta is a next-gen¬†Layer 1 blockchain and fintech protocol¬†designed from the ground up to serve as the¬†institutional-grade financial settlement layer¬†of the future.
With¬†10M+ TPS,¬†sub-second deterministic finality, and¬†native KYC/AML compliance, Keeta is¬†not just another crypto project‚Äîit's a full-stack replacement for SWIFT and traditional banking rails.

üí° What Makes Keeta Different?
* 10M+ TPS,¬†<0.4s finality,¬†$0.00005 fees
* Horizontally scalable: more nodes = more throughput (like Google Cloud infra)
* Client-driven consensus: voting happens¬†before¬†hitting the network = ultra low latency
* Every account is its own chain¬†‚Äì enables true parallel processing (pseudo-DAG architecture)
* Built-in KYC/AML compliance¬†‚Äì Travel Rule, PCI DSS Level 1, ISO 20022
* Supports¬†private subnets, asset restrictions, and bank-grade permission systems

üë• Who‚Äôs Behind It?
* Ty Schenk (CEO)¬†‚Äì ex-Nano ecosystem dev
* Roy Keene (CTO)¬†‚Äì Nano‚Äôs former lead dev
* Eric Schmidt¬†invested¬†$17M, calling it his biggest blockchain bet to date
* Branding by¬†Red Antler¬†(Chime, Ramp, Hinge)

üìÖ What‚Äôs Coming?
* Mainnet launch: Summer 2025
* Independent¬†10M TPS benchmark
* Reveal of¬†stablecoin provider
* Launch of¬†Anchors¬†(cross-chain & fiat bridges)
* Native¬†DEX¬†and¬†KeetaPay v2¬†relaunch

üí∏ Token Quick Info
* Token:¬†$KTA
* Supply: 1B total, 400M circulating
* Launch: Fair launch on Ethereum L2 (Base)
* Market Cap: ~$300M ‚Äì same as a memecoin üôÉ

Keeta isn't another L1 copycat. It‚Äôs a fully compliant, massively scalable¬†financial protocol¬†built for real-world adoption. This is¬†infrastructure-level¬†tech‚Äîway beyond hype.

reddit,s,I make 250$/day with reddit post,"Hi everyone!

One day I was just scrolling through my feed and randomly came across a post by¬†(u/almantas07) describing a way to make money using a web wallet. At first, I started arguing with the OP- I had never made money online before and it sounded sketchy  
But the guy turned out to be super down-to-earth and explained everything in detail After that, I decided to give it a shot. I only tried $20 at first and couldn‚Äôt believe it actually worked!  
That same evening, I got $100 sent to my personal wallet in just a few hours. Now I‚Äôve been using this method for 5 days already and made around $1300 total- it‚Äôs bringing me over $250 per day consistently

So yeah, I don‚Äôt regret trying it at all, and I figured it might help someone else too. Thanks for reading- and sorry if I wasted your time!

Wishing you all big numbers!",2025-07-11 08:07:16+00:00

reddit,s,How to buy pumpfun token in the USA,"1. Download VPN that allows you to change location. (I use windscribe because it's free.)

2. Deposit on Hyperliquid at hyperliquid.xyz

3. Sell deposit for USD on spot market

4. Convert spot to perps in your portfolio

5. Go to trade section and find pump in the perps section

6. Now you can long or short the pump token with up to 3x leverage

Please note token isn't live until Saturday If you buy before Saturday that's pre-market prices

I made this video tutorial as well if you prefer to follow along that way. Skip to 2:33 for the tutorial!

This time though, I‚Äôm not just joining the traders with events but  I‚Äôm aiming to lead a squad lol. I thought of this and see what happened, BTC just killed it.  

Might be overconfident, but I feel way more prepared now, especially after seeing how the whole thing played out last year.
And yeah, I saw bitget has bumped the prize pool to $6M and threw in some LaLiga/MotoGP perks  not bad at all, but honestly I'm more hyped for the strategy grind and seeing who actually shows up to play with btc.

reddit,s,Has my Pantom wallet been Compromised?,"Hi just after some advice. I'll try and explain it as best I can.
I was using phantom wallet. I swapped a meme coin I was holding for sol. After the swap it showed I still had a some of the meme coin left. I thought maybe it was just a glitch and it would correct it's self. 
Then I swapped the sol for pengu and 4 separate pengu's showed up in my wallet 1 with the amount I had swapped and 3 with with $2000 worth in.
I clicked on one, and when to swap to see what happened. When I clicked the max amount a yellow box popped up and said there was a issue.
Then I realised the 3 pengu's and the meme coin had slightly different spellings. so obviously scam coins.

But just wondering what I do now?
My balance now says I have thousands of dollars which I don't have, and I'm worried that my actual assets may get drained.

Do I make a new wallet and move my legitimate holdings out?

reddit,dai,From Wallet to Checkout: How Crypto Is Becoming a Daily Payment Option,"For over a decade, cryptocurrencies promised to revolutionize finance. But for most users, crypto remained something to hold‚Äînot something to spend. That is starting to change.

Thanks to stablecoins and crypto-native payment tools, digital assets can now be used for everyday transactions. From paying for groceries with a wallet-connected card to scanning QR codes at point-of-sale terminals, crypto is becoming spendable in ways that mirror traditional money.

This article explores how stablecoins, wallet-connected cards, and payment gateways are creating a complete, usable crypto payment stack. It covers the rise of stablecoins like USDC, tools like Pera Card and AEON Pay, and the infrastructure behind real-time crypto settlement. It also examines what this shift means for developers, businesses, and consumers worldwide.",2025-07-12 01:07:06+00:00
reddit,s,Why the Genius Act is positive for crypto,"The GENIUS Bill might be one of the most positive moves for crypto in the U.S. in a long time. It brings much-needed regulatory clarity by clearly defining what digital assets are ‚Äî separating decentralized projects from traditional securities. That alone would help reduce the fear that builders and investors have of surprise SEC crackdowns. It also protects developers, validators, and node operators from being treated like financial intermediaries, which is huge for keeping DeFi and open-source development alive.

What really stands out is the bill‚Äôs support for decentralization and innovation. It even proposes a ‚Äúsafe harbor‚Äù period for new projects, giving them space to grow without immediately getting caught in regulatory crosshairs. It‚Äôs not about letting scams run free ‚Äî fraud is still very much in the crosshairs ‚Äî but it is about making the U.S. a better place to build real crypto projects. It‚Äôs not law yet, but it‚Äôs a step in the right direction.

I didnt create a meme so will just write out a meme in interpretive text to make my point:
The scene shows a messy work area, a map, a calendar and other paraphernalia is seen in the background. the camera angle is positioned so it is tilted slightly upwards and shows ‚ÄòJoe Exotic‚Äô from Tiger King looming in the shot with a look of distress and deflation. On the top section of the meme the text reads ‚ÄòBTC loses 0.75% value‚Äô. The character of Joe Exotic has a poorly edited label ‚ÄòAltcoin‚Äô overlaid his face.

reddit,fil,New Scam: Ordinary reddit users with scams in their profile. Do not follow guides posted to anyone's user profile.,"**TL;DR - People who post like ordinary Redditors have scam guides in their user profiles. They want to steal money from ordinary people by pretending to be ordinary people.**                     

Quick forenote: This is **not** the ""I made 230 dollars in one day"" scam where another user gets tagged in the OP.                  

**If you encounter this kind of scammer** Please report the user and use a ""custom report option"" and then write something like ""Scam guide in user profile."" or ""This is a scammer, check their profile.""                   

Problem encountered: I saw a post that was written in a way to gain everyone's favor. It had more than 50, but less than 100 upvotes, and looked like it was any other post. The OP even asked what coins they should look into. But then a user reported the post, encouraging us to look into the user's profile. The scam posted was well-written, but had some red flags. ""Send 100 USD of eth to this wallet address and you'll get 101 USD of Eth back."" For those of you who don't know, the comments that are posted to the guide are all fake. The comments all say, ""Wow this worked. I can do this 9 times more today."" They take your crypto and run once it is sent.                  

#IMPORTANT: Do NOT write in the comments anything inflammatory to the scammer. If they know we are on to them, this could cause them to remove the posts from their profiles and then repost them on another day - turning this into a game of ""scammer whack-a-mole.""",2025-07-12 03:04:41+00:00

Second, why shouldn‚Äôt you try to make some quick profits off of some altcoins/shitcoins/memecoins, if you can? For example buy 5000$ of four or five different ones, wait for a pump, and sell it all for like 5500$, with a quick 500$ profit, and then rebuy back bitcoin and stack even more.

Why would you not do this, or why would this be a bad idea?

banknews,trump,Trump to host Jensen Huang at White House as Nvidia tops $4 trillion market cap,"Levi Strauss anticipates its sales and profits will grow more than it had expected this year ‚Äî as long as tariffs don‚Äôt get any higher. The jeans maker issued guidance that incorporated the new 30% tariff on Chinese imports, where Levi‚Äôs does little manufacturing, and 10% on the rest of the world, which is expected to change. CEO Michelle Gass told CNBC the company is doing what it can to absorb costs to avoid steep price increases.Levi Strauss raised its full-year guidance Thursday and said it‚Äôs working to absorb some of the costs it‚Äôs facing from higher tariffs, but that could change as President Donald Trump‚Äôs trade policy evolves. The denim maker doesn‚Äôt disclose its key manufacturing hubs, but much of its supply comes from Southeast Asia. Many countries in the region have been targeted by Trump‚Äôs so-called reciprocal tariff plan. Levi‚Äôs is currently expecting its full-year adjusted earnings to be between $1.25 to $1.30 per share, up from a prior forecast of between $1.20 and $1.25 and better than the $1.23 analysts had expected, according to LSEG. However, that forecast only assumes a 30% tariff on China, where Levi‚Äôs manufactures about 1% of its products, and a 10% tariff on the rest of the world, which could change as Trump negotiates trade deals with key manufacturing regions. In an interview with CNBC, Levi‚Äôs finance chief Harmit Singh said most of Levi‚Äôs sourcing is from countries like Pakistan, Bangladesh and Indonesia. Trump in recent days threatened Bangladesh and Indonesia with duties of more than 30%. It‚Äôs unclear how much of Levi‚Äôs products are sourced from those regions, and 60% of Levi‚Äôs business is outside of the U.S. For now, Levi‚Äôs said it‚Äôs planning to absorb what it can. As policy currently stands, it anticipates tariffs will only impact the business by $25 million to $30 million for the rest of the year, or 2 to 3 cents on earnings per share. ‚ÄúWe are doing our part. We are absorbing some of the costs. What helps is that our business is so strong,‚Äù said CEO Michelle Gass. ‚ÄúWe have been pulling back on promotions anyway, that‚Äôs leading to more full-price selling, and some of our new innovation, our new fits, we‚Äôre pricing at a premium, and they‚Äôre buying. So all of those things help us navigate this time of having the tariff headwind.‚Äù Beyond tariffs, Levi‚Äôs delivered fiscal second quarter earnings that beat expectations on the top and bottom lines. Here‚Äôs how the jeans company did compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG: Earnings per share: 22 cents adjusted vs. 13 cents expected Revenue: $1.45 billion vs. $1.37 billion expectedLevi‚Äôs shares rose about 8% in extended trading.The company‚Äôs reported net income for the three-month period that ended June 1 was $67 million, or 17 cents per share, compared with $18 million, or 4 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time charges related to restructuring and impairment expenses, among other costs, Levi posted earnings per share of 22 cents. Sales rose to $1.45 billion, up about 6% from $1.36 billion a year earlier. Given strong demand, Levi‚Äôs raised its full-year revenue guidance and now expects sales to rise between 1% and 2%, up from previous guidance of down 1% to 2%. That range is well ahead of expectations. Analysts had expected revenue to decline by 5.2%, according to LSEG. Levi‚Äôs did cut its gross margin guidance by 0.2 percentage points, and now expects gross margin to grow by 0.8 percentage points because of the impact tariffs are having on profits. Since Gass took over as the retailer‚Äôs CEO, she‚Äôs worked to cut off underperforming parts of the business. In May, the company announced it would sell its Dockers brand to Authentic Brands Group. She‚Äôs also worked to drive direct sales to consumers, focused on e-commerce and stores rather than wholesale partners like Macy‚Äôs and Kohl‚Äôs, because it comes with higher margins and gives the company better insights into its customers. During the quarter, Levi‚Äôs gross margin reached what it called a record 62.6%, driven by fewer markdowns, lower product costs and 11% growth in direct sales. Levi‚Äôs, which has long catered to a male shopper, is also trying to win over female consumers and expand from a denim company to one known for a wide range of apparel. During the quarter, it saw wins from those efforts, with revenue for women‚Äôs apparel up 14% and sales of tops up 16%. Levi‚Äôs women‚Äôs category is the retailer‚Äôs ‚Äúhighest gross margin business,‚Äù said Singh.‚ÄúThe consumer is definitely responding and voting for this direction. So as we look ahead, we‚Äôre confident,‚Äù Gass told CNBC. ‚ÄúWe know that there‚Äôs uncertainty in the world right now, but the consumer is proving quite resilient for Levi‚Äôs.‚Äù At the core of Levi‚Äôs strategy is ensuring it‚Äôs still relevant with consumers. A recent partnership with Beyonce has helped the company stay top of mind with shoppers, especially as the singer continues her Cowboy Carter tour.In May, the company launched a limited-edition drop of Beyonce x Levi‚Äôs T-shirts, the first product to come from the collaboration.It also started a partnership with Nike, which went live on Thursday on Levi‚Äôs website and some of its stores. The collection includes a denim-inspired take on the Air Max 95.",2025-07-10 16:22:57+00:00

Trump attributed fentanyl and Canada‚Äôs retaliatory tariffs as reasons for the rate The 35% duty might be increased if Canada continues to retaliate, Trump said. U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday announced a 35% tariff on Canadian imports, starting Aug. 1, citing that Ottawa had retaliated with tariffs against Washington.‚ÄúInstead of working with the United States, Canada retaliated with its own Tariffs,‚Äù Trump said to Mark Carney, prime minister of Canada, in a letter posted on Truth Social.He attributed fentanyl as a reason for the rate in the letter and said: ‚ÄúIf Canada works with me to stop the flow of Fentanyl, we will, perhaps, consider an adjustment to this letter.‚ÄùThe 35% tariffs will be separate from all sectoral tariffs, Trump said, threatening that the duty might be increased, if Canada continues to retaliate.‚ÄúIf for any reason you decide to raise your Tariffs, then, whatever the number you choose to raise them by, will be added onto the 35% that we charge,‚Äù Trump said in the post.‚ÄúGood transshipped to evade this higher tariff will be subjected to that higher tariff,‚Äù the letter said.Trump also added that the tariffs could be raised further, or slashed, depending on how Washington‚Äôs relationship with Ottawa pans out, while mentioning that his country faced challenges from Canada that go beyond fentanyl.‚Äú[Canada] has many Tariff, and Non-Tariff, Policies and Trade Barriers, which cause unsustainable Trade Deficits against the United States ...

Energy resources from Canada are subject to a lower 10% levy.Thursday‚Äôs letter came after the two countries agreed to resume the trade talks on June 29 and to work on hammering out a deal by July 21, according to a statement from the Department of Finance Canada.Trump had threatened to end all trade discussions with Canada, one of its largest trading partners, after Ottawa said it would not pause the imposition of a digital services tax on American firms.

And they are both brilliant people.I doubt seriously that they‚Äôre battling each other, but I do think they‚Äôre at the top of President Trump‚Äôs list for Fed chairman, at least for now.Here‚Äôs a key point, though: the Fed is in need of perestroika.In other words, the Fed has to be cleansed of its Deep State dislike of all things Donald Trump, and frankly its Deep State bureaucratic groupthink of deadwood economists with models that haven‚Äôt worked in 50 years ‚Äî who are now advising Chairman Jay Powell to fight Mr. Trump and his economic growth agenda.The next Fed chairman has to go toe-to-toe with the hundreds of Fed economists who are spurring Mr. Powell on in his fight against Mr. Trump‚Äôs tariff and reciprocity fair trade policies. Also, against Mr. Trump‚Äôs tax-cut policies.Economic growth does not cause inflation. Tariffs do not cause inflation.As per the recent paper by the Council of Economic Advisers chairman, Stephen Miran, and even the interview by the Chicago Fed president, Austan Goolsbee, where he acknowledged the real-world fact that exporters and American companies will eat the tariffs, not consumers.Of course, the Board of Governors has to be changed, and that will come over time.Importantly, however, presidents of the regional reserve banks have got to be rotated out. The vast majority of them are Obama-Biden lefties who are heavily biased against Mr. Trump.All this has to be changed: the chairman, the board, the regional reserve bank presidents, and the bulk of the Fed staff economists.I myself started my career at the New York Fed ‚Äî and am proud of it. I even had a chance to work with the great Paul Volcker.But the Fed, over the past 50 years or so, has atrophied into a self-serving, central-planning Deep State that is essentially ignoring and opposing the wishes of the 80 million people who voted for Mr. Trump for president.It‚Äôs time to end the Fed‚Äôs deep state.

banknews,ada,Trump announces 35% tariffs on Canada starting Aug 1,"President Donald Trump announced a blanket 50% tariff on imports from Brazil, citing his anger over the country‚Äôs treatment of its former president, Jair Bolsonaro. Trump‚Äôs tariffs would be imposed using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, a White House official said. Trump‚Äôs interpretation of his powers under that law is at the center of an ongoing lawsuit over his ‚Äúreciprocal‚Äù tariffs.President Donald Trump‚Äòs politically charged new tariff threat ‚Äî a blanket 50% duty on imports from Brazil ‚Äî stretches an interpretation of his powers that is already facing a high-stakes court challenge.Trump said in a letter Wednesday that he is imposing the massive new tariff at least partly in retaliation against Brazil‚Äôs treatment of its former president, Jair Bolsonaro.But to do so, he is citing a law that only grants him emergency economic powers in order to deal with certain foreign threats to the United States, a White House official told CNBC Thursday.That same law ‚Äî the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA ‚Äî is at the center of an ongoing lawsuit over Trump‚Äôs ‚Äúreciprocal‚Äù tariffs that is currently before a federal appeals court.Trump‚Äôs lawyers say his invocation of the law to impose those tariffs was an appropriate move to address multiple national emergencies, including ‚ÄúAmerica‚Äôs exploding trade deficit.‚ÄùThe White House did not immediately respond to CNBC‚Äôs questions about Trump‚Äôs letter to Brazil, including how Bolsonaro‚Äôs circumstances relate to Trump‚Äôs stated authority under IEEPA.While the latest levy on Brazilian imports may not have a direct impact on the lawsuit already underway, critics say it could further erode the administration‚Äôs credibility as Trump pursues an aggressive trade agenda.Trump‚Äôs letter announcing the tariff on Brazil ‚Äútakes abuse of power to a whole new level,‚Äù said Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., in a statement Thursday.Kaine vowed to ‚Äúuse all available means to block these latest job-killing tariffs.‚ÄùSen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, accused Trump of attempting to ‚Äúsacrifice the economy to settle his own personal scores, and it is far outside his legal authority.‚ÄùWhat‚Äôs IEEPA?IEEPA gives the president some powers to deal with national emergencies stemming from ‚Äúany unusual and extraordinary threat‚Äù that comes in whole or in large part from outside the U.S.Trump previously cited IEEPA in early April, when he slapped 10% tariffs on nearly all other countries‚Äô imports, plus higher rates on dozens of individual nations. His April 2 executive order announcing those tariffs also formally declared a national emergency. According to the order, foreign trade practices that ‚Äúcontribute to large and persistent annual United States goods trade deficits‚Äù have caused the loss of America‚Äôs ‚Äúindustrial capacity‚Äù and ‚Äúcompromised military readiness.‚Äù Trump temporarily suspended the higher tariffs a week later, following a trading frenzy in global markets.In late May, the U.S. Court of International Trade struck the reciprocal tariffs down, ruling that IEEPA did not authorize Trump to impose them.The judges in that case found that Trump‚Äôs assertion of ‚Äúunbounded‚Äù tariff-making power ‚Äúexceeds any tariff authority delegated to the President under IEEPA.‚ÄùBut in June, judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit paused that decision from taking effect while the case is still pending.‚ÄúWe‚Äôll have to see‚Äù if Trump‚Äôs tariff letter to Brazil could factor into the appeal, said Ilya Somin, a law professor who is representing plaintiffs in the case against the Trump administration.‚ÄúFor the moment, these new Brazil tariffs are not part of the case,‚Äù Somin said in a phone interview.But he added that the letter ‚Äúfurther underscores the indefensible nature‚Äù of Trump‚Äôs assertion that he has virtually ‚Äúunreviewable discretion‚Äù on tariffs.Trump‚Äôs letter to LulaThis week, Trump began a new strategy: firing off individual letters to world leaders that set new tariff rates on their countries‚Äô U.S. imports, starting Aug. 1.The nearly two dozen letters sent so far include identical language complaining about trade policies that have created ‚Äúpersistent‚Äù and ‚Äúunsustainable Trade Deficits against the United States.‚Äù‚ÄúThis Deficit is a major threat to our Economy and, indeed, our National Security!‚Äù they read.But Trump‚Äôs letter to Brazil takes things much further, by explicitly declaring that he is imposing tariffs because he opposes the recent political and legal developments in the country.Trump specifically decried Brazil‚Äôs treatment of Bolsonaro, who is facing trial over his role in an alleged coup to overturn his 2022 reelection loss.‚ÄúThis Trial should not be taking place,‚Äù Trump wrote in the letter to current President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. ‚ÄúIt is a Witch Hunt that should end IMMEDIATELY!‚Äù Trump loses appeal of $5 million E.

banknews,s,Options Corner: Why Low-Key Infrastructure Play Akamai Technologies Might Surprise You,"Although the innovation ecosystem has started to look interesting again as evidenced by the recent performance of the Nasdaq Composite index, Akamai Technologies Inc (NASDAQ:AKAM) has been a conspicuous laggard. Since the start of the year, the content delivery network (CDN) specialist ‚Äî which also offers robust cybersecurity and edge computing services ‚Äî has dropped nearly 17%. Nevertheless, AKAM stock could be an intriguing candidate for a sentiment reversal.Fundamentally, Akamai plays a vital role in how people and enterprises consume the internet ‚Äî it's just that the essential work occurs behind the scenes. Using a geographically distributed network of proxy servers, CDNs help speed up websites by storing cached content near end-users. This capability is especially critical for companies with content-streaming arms, such as Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX).Further, Akamai plays an important (albeit indirect) role in artificial intelligence. Today, many AI models ‚Äî especially those involving voice assistants, fraud detection services and personalized ads ‚Äî require low latency or minimal lag in data transmission between source and destination. Thanks to Akamai's edge computing infrastructure, AI workloads can run closer to the user, reducing delay and bandwidth strain.Finally, Akamai offers a strong cybersecurity suite, including advanced protocols such as zero-trust security. Given the importance of digital protection, it's arguably one of the key line items that companies can't afford to skimp out on.Unfortunately, recent financial performances reflect revenue pressures, which points to a highly competitive environment. Further, while Akamai is making progress in cybersecurity, that arena is also crowded. Essentially, the company needs to prove that its edge computing services can scale profitably; hence, the volatility in AKAM stock.Full story available on Benzinga.com",2025-07-10 20:39:28+00:00

Much of the mechanical ingenuity we know of in modern times began to develop only a couple hundred years ago, during the Industrial Revolution. However, evidence today alludes to advanced civilizations existing as long as several thousand years ago‚Äîor possibly even earlier.‚ÄúOopart‚Äù‚Äîor ‚Äúout-of-place artifact‚Äù‚Äîis the term given to numerous prehistoric objects found in various places across the world today that show a level of technological sophistication incongruous with our present paradigm.Many scientists attempt to explain these ooparts away as natural phenomena. Yet others say that such dismissive explanations only whitewash over the mounting evidence: that prehistoric civilizations had advanced knowledge, and this knowledge was lost over the ages only to be developed anew in modern times.We will look at a variety of ooparts here, ranging from millions to hundreds of years old in purported age, but all supposedly demonstrating advancement well beyond their time.Whether these are fact or merely fiction we cannot say. We can only offer a glimpse at what‚Äôs known, supposed, or hypothesized regarding these phenomena, in the spirit of being open-minded and geared toward real scientific discovery.17. 2,000-Year-Old Batteries?Clay jars with asphalt stoppers and iron rods made some 2,000 years ago have been proven capable of generating more than a volt of electricity. These ancient ‚Äúbatteries‚Äù were found by German archaeologist Wilhelm Konig in 1938, just outside of Baghdad, Iraq.Right: An illustration of a Baghdad battery from museum artifact pictures. (Ironie/Wikimedia Commons) Background: Map of area surrounding present-day Baghdad, Iraq. Cmcderm1/iStock/Thinkstock‚ÄúThe batteries have always attracted interest as curios,‚Äù Dr. Paul Craddock, a metallurgy expert at the British Museum, told the BBC in 2003. ‚ÄúThey are a one-off. As far as we know, nobody else has found anything like these. They are odd things; they are one of life‚Äôs enigmas.‚Äù16. Ancient Egyptian Light Bulb?A relief beneath the Temple of Hathor at Dendera, Egypt, depicts figures standing around a large light-bulb-like object. Erich Von DaÃàniken, who wrote ‚ÄúChariot of the Gods,‚Äù created a model of the bulb which works when connected to a power source, emitting an eerie, purplish light.The light-bulb-like object engraved in a crypt under the Temple of Hathor in Egypt. Lasse Jensen/CC BY 2.515. Great Wall of TexasIn 1852, in what is now known as Rockwall County, Texas, farmers digging a well discovered what appeared to be an ancient rock wall. Estimated to be some 200,000 to 400,000 years old, some say it‚Äôs a natural formation while others say it‚Äôs clearly man-made.A historic photo of the ‚Äúwall‚Äù found in Rockwall, Texas. Public DomainDr. John Geissman at the University of Texas in Dallas tested the rocks as part of a History Channel documentary. He found they were all magnetized the same way, suggesting they formed where they are and were not moved to that site from elsewhere. But some remain unconvinced by this single TV-show test and call for further studies.Geologist James Shelton and Harvard-trained architect John Lindsey have noted elements that seem to be of architectural design, including archways, linteled portals, and square openings that resemble windows.14. 1.8-Billion-Year-Old Nuclear Reactor?In 1972, a French factory imported uranium ore from Oklo, in Africa‚Äôs Gabon Republic. The uranium had already been extracted. They found the site of origin to have apparently functioned as a large-scale nuclear reactor that came into being 1.8 billion years ago and was in operation for some 500,000 years.Nuclear reactor site, Oklo, Gabon Republic. NASADr. Glenn T. Seaborg, former head of the United States Atomic Energy Commission and Nobel Prize winner for his work in the synthesis of heavy elements, believed it wasn‚Äôt a natural phenomenon, and thus must be a man-made nuclear reactor.For uranium to ‚Äúburn‚Äù in a reaction, very precise conditions are needed. The water must be extremely pure, for one‚Äîmuch purer than exists naturally. The material U-235 is necessary for nuclear fission to occur. It is one of the isotopes found naturally in uranium. Several specialists in reactor engineering have said they believe the uranium in Oklo could not have been rich enough in U-235 for a reaction to take place naturally.13. Sea-Faring Map Makers Before Antarctica Was Covered in Ice?A map created by Turkish admiral and cartographer Piri Reis in 1513, but sourced from various earlier maps, is thought by some to depict Antarctica as it was in a very remote age before it was covered with ice.A portion of the Piri Reis map of 1513. Public DomainA landmass is shown to jut out from the southern coastline of South America. Captain Lorenzo W. Burroughs, a U.S. Air Force captain in the cartographic section, wrote a letter to Dr. Charles Hapgood in 1961 saying that this landmass seems to accurately show Antarctica‚Äôs coast as it is under the ice.Dr. Hapgood (1904‚Äì1982) was one of the first to publicly suggest that the Piri Reis map depicts Antarctica during a prehistoric time. He was a Harvard-educated historian whose theories about geological shifts earned the admiration of Albert Einstein. He hypothesized that the land masses shifted, explaining why Antarctica is shown as connected to South America.Modern studies refute Hapgood‚Äôs theory that such a shift could have taken place within thousands of years, but they show it could have happened within millions of years.12. 2,000-Year-Old Earthquake DetectorIn 132 A.D., Zhang Heng created the world‚Äôs first seismoscope. How exactly it works remains a mystery, but replicas have worked with a precision comparable to modern instruments.A replica of an ancient Chinese seismoscope from the Eastern Han Dynasty (25-220 A.D.), and its inventor, Zhang Heng. Wikimedia CommonsIn 138 A.D., it correctly indicated that an earthquake occurred about 300 miles west of Luoyang, the capital city. No one had felt the quake in Luoyang and dismissed the warning until a messenger arrived days later, requesting aid.11. 150,000-Year-Old Pipes?Caves near Mount Baigong in China contain pipes leading to a nearby lake. They were dated by the Beijing Institute of Geology to about 150,000 years ago, according to Brian Dunning of Skeptoid.com.A file photo of a pipe, and a view of Qinghai Lake in China, near which mysterious iron pipes were found. NASA; Pipe image via Zhax/ShutterstockState-run media Xinhua reported that the pipes were analyzed at a local smeltery and 8 percent of the material could not be identified. Zheng Jiandong, a geology research fellow from the China Earthquake Administration, told state-run newspaper People‚Äôs Daily, in 2007, that some of the pipes were found to be highly radioactive.Jiandong said iron-rich magma may have risen from deep in the Earth, bringing the iron into fissures where it may have solidified into tubes; though he admitted, ‚ÄúThere is indeed something mysterious about these pipes.‚Äù He cited the radioactivity as an example of the strange qualities of the pipes.10. Antikythera MechanismA mechanism often referred to as an ancient ‚Äúcomputer,‚Äù which was built by Greeks around 150 B.C., was able to calculate astronomical changes with great precision.The Antikythera Mechanism is a 2000-year-old mechanical device used to calculate the positions of the sun, moon, planets, and even the dates of the ancient Olympic Games. Marsyas/CC by SA 3.0‚ÄúIf it hadn‚Äôt been discovered ... no one would possibly believe that it could exist because it‚Äôs so sophisticated,‚Äù said Mathematician Tony Freeth in a NOVA documentary. Mathias Buttet, director of research and development for watch-maker Hublot, said in a video released by the Hellenic Republic Ministry of Culture and Tourism, ‚ÄúThis Antikythera Mechanism includes ingenious features which are not found in modern watch-making.‚Äù9. Drill Bit in CoalJohn Buchanan, Esq., presented a mysterious object to a meeting of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland on Dec. 13, 1852. A drill bit had been found encapsulated in coal about 22 inches thick, buried in a bed of clay mixed with boulders about 7 feet thick.File image of coal (Kkymek/iStock) File image of a drill Konstik/iStock; edited by Epoch TimesThe Earth‚Äôs coal is said to have formed hundreds of millions of years ago. The Society decided that the instrument was of a modern level of advancement. But it concluded that ‚Äúthe iron instrument might have been part of a borer broken during some former search for coal.‚ÄùBuchanan‚Äôs detailed report did not include any signs that the coal surrounding the instrument had been punctured by drilling.8. 2.8-Billion-Year-Old Spheres?Spheres with fine grooves around them, found in mines in South Africa, have been said by some to be naturally formed masses of mineral matter. Others have said they were precisely shaped by a prehistoric human hand.Top left, bottom right: Spheres, known as Klerksdorp spheres, found in the pyrophyllite (wonderstone) deposits near Ottosdal, South Africa. (Robert Huggett) Top right, bottom left: Similar objects known as Moqui marbles from the Navajo Sandstone of southeast Utah. Paul Heinrich‚ÄúThe globes, which have a fibrous structure on the inside with a shell around it, are very hard and cannot be scratched, even by steel,‚Äù said Roelf Marx, curator of the museum of Klerksdorp, South Africa, according to Michael Cremo‚Äôs book, ‚ÄúForbidden Archaeology: The Hidden History of the Human Race.‚Äù Marx said the spheres are about 2.8 billion years old.If they are mineral masses, it is unclear how exactly they formed.7. Iron Pillar of DelhiThis pillar is at least 1,500 years old but could be older. It remains rust-free and is of astounding purity. It is 99.72 percent iron, according to professor A.P. Gupta, head of the Department of Applied Sciences and Humanities at the Institute of Technology and Management in India.An inscription from about 400 A.D. by King Chandragupta II on the Iron Pillar of Delhi. Venus Upadhayaya/Epoch TimesIn modern times, wrought iron has been made with a purity of 99.8 percent, but it contains manganese and sulfur, two ingredients absent in the pillar.It was made at least ‚Äú400 years before the largest known foundry of the world could have produced it,‚Äù wrote John Rowlett in ‚ÄúA Study of the Craftsmen of Ancient and Medieval Civilizations to Show the Influence of their Training on our Present Day Method of Trade Education.‚Äù6. Viking Sword UlfberhtWhen archaeologists found the Viking sword Ulfberht, dating from 800 to 1000 A.D., they were stunned. They couldn‚Äôt see how the technology to make such a sword would have been available until the Industrial Revolution, 800 years later.An Ulfberht sword displayed at the Germanisches Nationalmuseum, Nuremberg, Germany. Martin Kraft/CC BY-SA 3.0Its carbon content is three times higher than other swords of its time and impurities were removed to such a degree that the iron ore must have been heated to at least 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit.With great effort and precision, modern blacksmith Richard Furrer of Wisconsin forged a sword of Ulfberht quality using technology that would have been available in the Middle Ages. He said it was the most complicated thing he'd ever made, and he used methods not known to have been used by people of that time.5. 100-Million-Year-Old Hammer?A hammer was found in London, Texas, in 1934, encased in stone that had formed around it. The rock surrounding the hammer is said to be more than 100 million years old.Glen J. Kuban, a vocal skeptic of claims that the hammer was made millions of years ago, said the stone may contain materials that are more than 100 million years old, but that doesn‚Äôt mean the rock formed around the hammer so long ago.He said that some limestone has formed around artifacts known to be from the 20th century, so concretions can form fairly quickly around objects. (Concretions are masses of hardened mineral matter).Carl Baugh, who was in possession of the artifact, has said the wooden handle has turned to coal (evidence of its great age) and that the metal its made of has a strange composition. Critics have called for independent testing to verify these claims, but so far no such testing has been conducted.4. Prehistoric Work Site?Workers at a stone quarry near Aix-en-Provence, France, in the 18th century, came across tools stuck in a layer of limestone 50 feet underground.The find was recorded in the American Journal of Science and Arts in 1820 by T. D. Porter, who was translating Count Bournon‚Äôs work, ‚ÄúMineralogy.‚ÄùA file photo of a limestone rock formation. Andrew Roland/ShutterstockThe wooden instruments had turned into agate, a hard stone. Porter wrote: ‚ÄúEverything tended to prove that this work had been executed upon the spot where the traces existed. The presence of man had then preceded the formation of this stone, and that very considerably since he was already arrived at such a degree of civilization that the arts were known to him, and that he wrought the stone and formed columns out of it.‚ÄùAs stated in the case of the hammer above, limestone has been known to form relatively quickly around modern tools.3. Million-Year-Old Bridge?According to ancient Indian legend, King Rama built a bridge between India and Sri Lanka more than a million years ago. What appears to be remnants of such a bridge have been seen from satellite images, but many say its a natural formation.Adam‚Äôs Bridge, also known as Rama‚Äôs Bridge, or Ram Setu, between India and Sri Lanka. NASADr. Badrinarayanan, former director of the Geological Survey of India, studied core samples from the bridge. He was puzzled by the appearance of boulders on top of a marine sand layer, and surmised that the boulders must have been artificially placed there.No single natural explanation has been agreed upon by geologists. Dating has been controversial, as some say any given part of the bridge (such as coral samples) cannot give a true picture of how old the entire bridge is.2. 500,000-Year-Old Spark Plug?In 1961, three people were out searching for geodes for their gem and gift shop in Olancha, California, when they found what appeared to be a spark plug encased in a geode. Virginia Maxey, one of the three discoverers, said at the time that a geologist examined the fossils around the device and dated the device at 500,000 years old or older.The geologist was never named, and the current whereabouts of the artifact are unknown. Critics of the claim, Pierre Stromberg and Paul V. Heinrich, only have x-rays and an artist‚Äôs sketch of the artifact to analyze. They think it was a modern spark plug encased in a quick-forming concretion rather than a geode.But, Stromberg and Heinrich have said, ‚ÄúThere is little hard evidence that the original discoverers intended to deceive anyone.‚Äù1. Prehistoric Wall Near Bahamas?A wall of rock in large, thick block shapes was found off the coast of the Bahamas in 1968. Archaeologist William Donato has conducted multiple dives to investigate the wall and hypothesizes it is a man-made structure some 12,000 to 19,000 years old, built to protect a prehistoric settlement from waves.He‚Äôs found it to be a multi-tiered structure including prop stones that appear to be placed there by human hands. He‚Äôs also found what he believes to be anchor stones with rope holes in them.Stones submerged off the coast of the Bahamas, said by some to be a man-made wall, more than 10,000 years old. FtLaud/ShutterstockDr. Eugene Shinn, a retired geologist who worked for the U.S. Geological Survey, has said core rock samples he took show a dip toward deep water. If all the cores show a dip toward deep water, this would prove the rock formed where it is and did not form elsewhere, later to be transported by humans to its present location.His later writings said that all of his samples showed this dip, seeming to prove it is a natural formation. But his earlier study stated that only 25 percent of his samples showed a dip.Dr. Greg Little, a psychologist who has taken an interest in this structure, confronted Shinn about this discrepancy and Shinn admitted he didn‚Äôt really take his study seriously. He said, ‚ÄúI got a little carried away to make a good story.‚Äù Tyler DurdenThu, 07/10/2025 - 16:20",2025-07-10 20:20:00+00:00

Ronaldo Schemidt/AFPThe hardest hit region, Kerr County - known for its summer camps and riverfront retreats - accounted for 95 of the fatalities, including 59 adults and 36 children, local officials said on Wednesday. Among the dead are at least 27 campers and counselors from Camp Mystic, a century-old Christian camp for girls nestled along the banks of the Guadalupe River in Hunt, Texas.Sheriff Larry Leitha, whose department has been coordinating the response in Kerr County, said more than two dozen of those killed remain unidentified, underscoring the challenges posed by the scale of the disaster and the swiftness of the floodwaters.More than a foot of rain fell in under an hour on Saturday evening, officials said, triggering a sudden and violent rise in the Guadalupe River, which surged nearly 30 feet above normal levels - inundating low-lying areas, sweeping away vehicles, and overwhelming even elevated structures.Governor Greg Abbott said Wednesday that more than 170 people across the region remain unaccounted for. Of those, 161 are believed to be missing in Kerr County alone, including five children and one counselor from Camp Mystic.""We will not stop until every missing person is accounted for,"" said Abbott. The additional 24 deaths occurred in neighboring counties; Travis, Burnet, Kendall, Tom Green, and Williamson, as the storm system carved a path of destruction through the Hill Country region, long known for its natural beauty and quiet charm.Search and rescue teams, along with volunteers, continue to comb the area in an effort to locate the missing. Efforts are focused along miles of riverbank, where debris and strong currents have hampered access.Authorities have not yet released a full accounting of property damage, but officials described the scale of destruction in central Texas as catastrophic. Governor Abbott‚Äôs office has not issued a formal disaster declaration as of Wednesday, but emergency personnel from multiple jurisdictions remain deployed.Officials have not provided details on weather conditions in the days ahead, and it remains unclear whether additional rainfall could impact recovery operations.As the search continues, families and local communities are grappling with grief and uncertainty. State agencies are coordinating with local authorities to provide support and assistance to survivors and displaced residents. Tyler DurdenThu, 07/10/2025 - 16:40",2025-07-10 20:40:00+00:00

banknews,pi,This CEO's startup has raised $92 million and is backed by Sundar Pichai. He shares his ‚Äòsuperpower' tip for aspiring entrepreneurs,"U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday announced a 35% tariff on Canadian imports, starting Aug. 1. Trump attributed fentanyl and Canada‚Äôs retaliatory tariffs as reasons for the rate. The 35% duty might be increased if Canada continues to retaliate, Trump said. Canadian prime minister Mark Carney said the Canadian government has ‚Äústeadfastly defended our workers and businesses‚Äù during its trade negotiation with the Trump administration.U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday raised tariffs on Canadian imports to 35%, effective Aug. 1, complaining that Ottawa had retaliated with duties against Washington.‚ÄúInstead of working with the United States, Canada retaliated with its own Tariffs,‚Äù Trump said to Mark Carney, prime minister of Canada, in a letter posted on Truth Social.He attributed fentanyl as a reason for that rate in the letter: ‚ÄúIf Canada works with me to stop the flow of Fentanyl, we will, perhaps, consider an adjustment to this letter.‚ÄùResponding to Trump‚Äôs announcement, Carney said in a post on X that ‚ÄúCanada has made vital progress to stop the scourge of fentanyl in North America. We are committed to continuing to work with the United States to save lives and protect communities in both our countries.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Canadian government has steadfastly defended our workers and businesses. We will continue to do so as we work towards the revised deadline of August 1.‚ÄùThe 35% tariffs will be separate from all sectoral tariffs, Trump said, warning that the duty might be increased, if Canada continues to retaliate. Canada is already subject to Trump‚Äôs 50% tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, 25% tariffs on autos, and faces a 50% levy on copper shipments starting Aug. 1.‚ÄúIf for any reason you decide to raise your Tariffs, then, whatever the number you choose to raise them by, will be added onto the 35% that we charge,‚Äù Trump said Thursday. ‚ÄúGood transshipped to evade this higher tariff will be subject to that higher tariff.‚ÄùTrump indicated that the tariff rates in future will depend on how Washington‚Äôs relationship with Ottawa pans out, while mentioning that his country faced challenges from Canada that went beyond fentanyl.‚Äú[Canada] has many Tariff, and Non-Tariff, Policies and Trade Barriers, which cause unsustainable Trade Deficits against the United States ... The Trade Deficit is a major threat to our Economy and, indeed, our National Security!‚ÄùSeparately, Trump told NBC news Thursday that he intends to impose blanket tariffs of 15% or 20% on most trade partners, up from the current 10%.Imports from Canada into the U.S. currently attract a 25% levy that Trump imposed earlier this year over the country‚Äôs alleged role in the flow of fentanyl, with exemptions for those in compliance with the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. Energy resources from Canada are subject to a lower 10% levy.Thursday‚Äôs letter came after the two countries agreed to resume the trade talks on June 29 and to work on hammering out a deal by July 21, according to a statement from the Department of Finance Canada.Trump had threatened to end all trade discussions with Canada, one of its largest trading partners, after Ottawa said it would not pause the imposition of a ‚Äúdigital services tax‚Äù on American firms. Canada later withdrew that tax in order to restart trade talks with Washington.In response to Trump‚Äôs duties, Ottawa had also imposed 25% tariffs on non-USMCA complaint vehicles from the U.S. and a list of American exports including steel, aluminum, computers, apparels and food earlier this year. The countermeasures, Canada said in March, would stay ‚Äúuntil the U.S. eliminates its tariffs against Canadian steel and aluminum products.‚ÄùU.S. total goods trade with Canada was $761.8 billion in 2024, with Washington‚Äôs deficit standing at $62 billion last year, according to U.S. Census data.

banknews,s,FDA Approves Moderna's COVID-19 Vaccine For Some Children,"FDA Approves Moderna's COVID-19 Vaccine For Some Children Authored by Zachary Stieber via The Epoch Times,Federal regulators have approved a COVID-19 vaccine made by Moderna for some children aged 6 months through 11 years, according to an approval letter made public on July 10.The Food and Drug Administration approved Spikevax, the vaccine, for children at least 6 months of age who are pegged as being at heightened risk for COVID-19, the FDA‚Äôs top vaccine official, Dr. Vinay Prasad, told Moderna in the missive.‚ÄúCOVID-19 continues to pose a significant potential threat to children, especially those with underlying medical conditions,‚Äù Moderna CEO SteÃÅphane Bancel said in a statement. ‚ÄúVaccination can be an important tool for protecting our youngest against severe disease and hospitalization. We appreciate the FDA‚Äôs diligent scientific review and approval of Spikevax for pediatric populations at increased risk for COVID-19 disease.‚ÄùThe FDA did not respond to a request for comment.The approval for the vaccine also covers other individuals through 64 years of age who have at least one risk factor that federal officials say places them at higher risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes, as well as all people aged at least 65.The updated vaccine could target L.P.8.1., based on guidance from the FDA. Moderna says it expects to have the updated vaccine ready to distribute in the fall.The FDA in 2024 granted emergency authorization for Spikevax for all children aged 6 months through 11 years. The FDA had also approved Spikevax for individuals aged at least 12 years.Those moves came despite no clinical data being available for the vaccines.FDA officials at the time said that animal data and information from previous versions of the shots were sufficient.Approval has a higher bar of evidence of safety and efficacy than emergency authorization.The new approval was based on three clinical trials, according to Prasad, including one that found the vaccine triggered antibodies and that placebo recipients were more likely to test positive for COVID-19. Results for the other two trials are not yet publicly available, with one still listed as ongoing.Americans have largely stopped receiving COVID-19 vaccines. Just 13 percent of children and 23 percent of adults had received one of the currently available vaccines as of April 26, according to the latest statistics available from the CDC.Prasad and Dr. Marty Makary, the FDA‚Äôs new commissioner, announced in May that the agency would no longer clear COVID-19 vaccines for people younger than 65 who lack a risk factor, such as obesity, that officials say places them at higher risk for severe COVID-19 outcomes.The officials also said they would keep clearing shots for some 100 million to 200 million Americans who are either elderly or have a risk factor, based on data showing vaccines trigger antibodies.The CDC later in May stopped recommending COVID-19 vaccines for healthy children and pregnant women, although it said children could receive a shot after consulting with parents and their doctors.The FDA on May 31 approved a different Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, called mNEXSPIKE, for adults aged at least 65 and people aged 12 to 64 who have at least one of the risk factors.Moderna is also working on a combination vaccine against COVID-19 and influenza. The company said in June that results from a study of an updated flu vaccine were favorable and that it planned to ask the FDA for clearance for the combination shot.

Christina Bu, secretary general of the Norwegian EV Association (NEVA), said Tesla‚Äôs revamped Model Y is ‚Äúdefinitely part of the reason‚Äù for its recent sales boost. Tesla‚Äôs brand value has been declining since 2024 in part because of CEO Elon Musk‚Äôs rhetoric and political activity.OSLO, Norway ‚Äî Tesla continues to find solace in Norway, defying a sustained European slump amid a backlash over CEO Elon Musk‚Äòs incendiary political rhetoric.The U.S. electric vehicle maker recorded a 54% year-on-year jump in new car sales in Norway in June, according to data from the Norwegian Road Federation (OFV), fueled by a 115.3% yearly increase in registrations for its revamped Model Y sports utility vehicle.The data backed up a whopping 213% increase in new car sales in May and shored up Tesla‚Äôs dominant position in the world‚Äôs most EV-friendly country.Christina Bu, secretary general of the Norwegian EV Association (NEVA), which represents electric car owners in the country, said Tesla has been well established in Norway for several years ‚Äî but the popularity of its upgraded Model Y is ‚Äúdefinitely part of the reason‚Äù for its recent sales boost.‚ÄúIn general terms, I think it just has to do with the fact that they deliver a car which has quite a lot of value for money and is what Norwegians need,‚Äù Bu told CNBC during an interview at NEVA‚Äôs office in Oslo.The Tesla Model Y appears to be especially popular in Norway because of its competitive price and the fact that it meets local demand for large luggage space, high-ground clearance, all-wheel drive and a tow hitch, Bu said.Read moreNorway is set to become the first country to fully transition to electric vehiclesTesla‚Äôs European car sales nosedive for fifth month as customers switch to Chinese EVsHow Tesla became the top-selling car company in NorwaySales data from southern Europe signaled some further green shoots for Musk‚Äôs company, with Tesla new car registrations last month increasing by 61% in Spain and around 7% in Portugal.The story remains very different across the rest of Europe, however. Tesla sales in Germany, Europe‚Äôs largest automotive hub, dropped by 60% in June from a year earlier, while sales also dipped in France.Separate data from the European Automobile Manufacturers Association, or ACEA, found Tesla‚Äôs new car sales in Europe fell for a fifth straight month in May.Tesla backlashTesla‚Äôs brand value has been declining since 2024 in part because of Musk‚Äôs political activity.The Tesla CEO, who spent nearly $300 million to support Donald Trump‚Äòs election campaign, recently left the White House after leading an initiative to slash federal agencies. Protests erupted at Tesla dealerships across Europe in response to Musk‚Äôs role in the Trump administration.Musk‚Äôs departure from the White House in late May was followed by an extraordinary war of words with Trump.

What Elon Musk has been saying and doing the last year or so ‚Äî so it definitely affects people, but not too many because their market share is remarkable really,‚Äù Bu said.Norway‚Äôs EV credentialsFor its part, Norway has long been recognized as a global leader in sustainable transportation. Indeed, it is currently on track to become the first country in the world to effectively erase gasoline and diesel cars from its new car market.Lawmakers and analysts have attributed the country‚Äôs shift away from internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles to long-term and consistent policies designed to support the uptake of EVs.‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs a combination of several things, but it is policymaking that has driven this forward,‚Äù Norway‚Äôs Deputy Transport Minister Cecilie Knibe Kroglund told CNBC in Oslo.‚ÄúWe have a lot of incentives, both tax incentives and user incentives are the most important things and also infrastructure, of course. But policymaking and incentives are the main tools that we have been using,‚Äù she added.Some of Norway‚Äôs EV incentives include a VAT exemption, discounts on road and parking taxes and access to bus lanes.

Every economy--from households to empires, meaning this is scale-invariant--generates a surplus from its production of goods and services, or it runs a deficit, meaning it has to get more money from somewhere to support its consumption.The question then becomes, how is the primary surplus being spent? (Or put another way, how is it being distributed across the economy and society?) There are only three options: 1) consume it, 2) invest it and 3) save it / hoard it.Without making a conscious choice, the US has chosen to ""invest"" most of its primary surplus in moral rot, unproductive frauds, skims, scams, monopolies, cartels, regulatory capture, grift and graft.This is the problem with giving an irresponsible teenager a no-limit Platinum credit card with an easily ignored admonishment to ""stick to a tight budget, pay the balance off every month."" Uh, right.Since the US can borrow unlimited trillions on its credit card, we can ""afford"" to burn our surplus on grift, graft, inefficiency, cronyism, profiteering, etc. Since our surplus was squandered on moral rot, we have to borrow trillions to pay for what the citizenry wants and what politicians must promise to get re-elected.Wetware 1.0: we like windfalls and free stuff, and so every program becomes a ""third rail"" politically: touch it and you don't get re-elected. But if you borrow a few ""free"" trillions a year, you get re-elected.We love windfalls and free stuff and hate hard choices, but that's all we have now. We have three choices in how we deal with our dependence on parabolic debt to sustain our profligate lifestyle:1. Run the debt up to the point that nobody is dumb enough to lend us more, and then default on the debt / go bankrupt. All our creditors are wiped out.The problem here is all debt is an asset to the wealthy entity that owns it as an income stream. Since the wealthy run the status quo in a manner that serves their interests, they're unlikely to be thrilled with debt jubilees that zero out their assets and income or messy defaults that end up doing the same thing.So nix that option. The wealthy want to keep their wealth and income streams, and since they own US Treasuries, they're not going to approve defaulting on that debt.2. Inflate the debt away with sustained high inflation. So we borrowed $1 when $1 bought a lot of stuff, and now we've inflated everything so it takes $10 to buy what $1 bought back then. Now we can pay back the $1 with a fraction of the earnings it took back when we borrowed it.We've already taken that step--what once cost $1 now costs $10. So the next step is to do another 10X reduction in the debt via inflation.In previous eras, authorities reduced the silver content of coinage to near-zero, effectively devaluing the money, i.e. inflating away the debt. What cost one mostly-silver denarius in the good old days soon cost 100 devalued denarius.This looks like some pretty easy hocus-pocus to pull off, but there's a catch: Catch-19, which is devaluing the money devalues trust in the leadership, social contract and the future, all of which leaves the economy and society a hollowed-out shell awaiting a stiff breeze to push the whole system off the cliff.The problem here is inflation is distributed asymmetrically, along with the primary surplus. The wealthy, powerful elites skim off the surplus, and they're equally adept at distributing the ""inflation tax"" to the middle and working classes, which soon meld into a single class, the impoverished.A funny thing about Wetware 1.0 is we're hard-wired to take note of rampant unfairness and eventually we respond in a destabilizing fashion, for example, uprisings, revolts, revolutions, etc.3. The third option is to root out all the moral rot that's consuming the economy's surplus and our future, scrap all the programs designed in the bygone eras of 50+ years ago (defense, Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, higher education, etc.) and start from scratch with new programs whose expenses are limited to what the economy generates as surplus.In other words, go Cold Turkey on our addiction to living on debt.Yes, I know: ain't gonna happen, because the moral rot is too deep, it's now normalized to the point that we don't even recognize the reality that there's nothing left but a flimsy facade we paint with gaudy colors to hide the rot.Everyone assumes the empire is forever and can endlessly fund any amount of grift and graft with borrowed money. But this is a self-serving fantasy, not reality. Every empire of debt implodes.These charts are merely facts. If we find them depressing, that response says something about our refusal to be accountable and responsible for our choices. Who's going to cut up the unlimited Platinum card?The federal government's Platinum card balance:The US economy's Platinum card balance:Student loans Platinum card balance:Medicare, which has an unlimited Platinum card:Medicaid, which also has an unlimited Platinum card, though this is obscured by phony ""reforms"":There are only three options, none easy, and not making a choice is a greased slide to collapse. The moral rot of unlimited debt looks ""free"" but it's unaffordable in the end.* * *Check out my new book Ultra-Processed Life and my new fiction/novels page.Become a $3/month patron of my work via patreon.com.Subscribe to my Substack for free Tyler DurdenThu, 07/10/2025 - 19:15",2025-07-10 23:15:00+00:00

Analysts doubtful about the valuation of Starbucks‚Äô China business. ‚ÄúNew bull case‚Äù for the market.Homo economicus, or the ‚Äúeconomic man,‚Äù is an idea that depicts humans as rational beings. This assumption has been used to construct models of the economy and, more broadly, society.The great flaw in that theory is the supposition of logic in humans. We know, on an everyday basis, how flimsy that notion is. We need to keep our blood cholesterol in check, but the crunch of that fried chicken is irresistible.On Thursday, the U.S. Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought accused Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell of shooting over the budget to renovate the central bank‚Äôs headquarters by roughly $700 million.In the same breath, he also questioned why there weren‚Äôt any ‚Äúrooftop terrace gardens, VIP private dining rooms and elevators, water features, premium marble, and much more‚Äù constructed, as was originally planned.To be fair, if all the allegations are true ‚Äî that the promised luxury features factored into the budget had been omitted while costs have busted expectations ‚Äî that would constitute mismanagement. At this point, however, either the budget or the fountain‚Äôs got to give.The accusation, more fundamentally, raises the question of whether U.S. President Donald Trump ‚Äî who has engaged in multiple tirades against Powell ‚Äî will use this incident to boot the Fed chair.The idea of ‚Äúhomo economicus‚Äù was widely criticized in the late 20th century.

He shares his ‚Äòsuperpower' tip for aspiring entrepreneurs,"U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday announced a 35% tariff on Canadian imports, starting Aug. 1. Trump attributed fentanyl and Canada‚Äôs retaliatory tariffs as reasons for the rate. The 35% duty might be increased if Canada continues to retaliate, Trump said. Canadian prime minister Mark Carney said the Canadian government has ‚Äústeadfastly defended our workers and businesses‚Äù during its trade negotiation with the Trump administration.U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday raised tariffs on Canadian imports to 35%, effective Aug. 1, complaining that Ottawa had retaliated with duties against Washington.‚ÄúInstead of working with the United States, Canada retaliated with its own Tariffs,‚Äù Trump said to Mark Carney, prime minister of Canada, in a letter posted on Truth Social.He attributed fentanyl as a reason for that rate in the letter: ‚ÄúIf Canada works with me to stop the flow of Fentanyl, we will, perhaps, consider an adjustment to this letter.‚ÄùResponding to Trump‚Äôs announcement, Carney said in a post on X that ‚ÄúCanada has made vital progress to stop the scourge of fentanyl in North America. We are committed to continuing to work with the United States to save lives and protect communities in both our countries.‚Äù‚ÄúThe Canadian government has steadfastly defended our workers and businesses. We will continue to do so as we work towards the revised deadline of August 1.‚ÄùThe 35% tariffs will be separate from all sectoral tariffs, Trump said, warning that the duty might be increased, if Canada continues to retaliate. Canada is subject to Trump‚Äôs 50% tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, 25% tariffs on autos, and faces a 50% levy on copper shipments starting Aug. 1.Other imports from Canada into the U.S. currently attract a 25% levy that Trump imposed earlier this year over the country‚Äôs alleged role in the flow of fentanyl, with exemptions for those in compliance with the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. Energy imports from Canada are subject to a lower 10% levy.‚ÄúIf for any reason you decide to raise your Tariffs, then, whatever the number you choose to raise them by, will be added onto the 35% that we charge,‚Äù Trump said Thursday. ‚ÄúGood transshipped to evade this higher tariff will be subject to that higher tariff.‚ÄùTrump indicated that the tariff rates in future will depend on how Washington‚Äôs relationship with Ottawa pans out, while mentioning that his country faced challenges from Canada that went beyond fentanyl.‚Äú[Canada] has many Tariff, and Non-Tariff, Policies and Trade Barriers, which cause unsustainable Trade Deficits against the United States ... The Trade Deficit is a major threat to our Economy and, indeed, our National Security!‚ÄùSeparately, Trump told NBC news Thursday that he intends to impose blanket tariffs of 15% or 20% on most trade partners, up from the current 10%.Thursday‚Äôs letter came after the two countries agreed to resume the trade talks on June 29 and to work on hammering out a deal by July 21, according to a statement from the Department of Finance Canada.Trump had threatened to end all trade discussions with Canada, one of its largest trading partners, over Ottawa‚Äôs ‚Äúdigital services tax‚Äù on American firms. Canada withdrew that tax on June 29 in order to restart trade talks with Washington.In response to Trump‚Äôs duties, Ottawa had also imposed 25% tariffs on non-USMCA complaint vehicles from the U.S. and a list of American exports including steel, aluminum, computers, apparels and food earlier this year. The countermeasures, Canada said in March, would stay ‚Äúuntil the U.S. eliminates its tariffs against Canadian steel and aluminum products.‚ÄùU.S. total goods trade with Canada was $761.8 billion in 2024, with Washington‚Äôs deficit standing at $62 billion last year, according to U.S. Census data.

banknews,s,California Might Stop Making Necessary Debt Payments For 2 Years,"California Might Stop Making Necessary Debt Payments For 2 Years Authored by John Moorlach via The Epoch Times,It‚Äôs July. The California State Legislature has successfully met the budget submission deadline of June 15, and it was signed by the governor. There was one small fly in the ointment: how to cut $12 billion in spending? All while trying to provide $750 million in tax credits annually to one specific industry: Hollywood. Go figure.One massive spending reduction strategy that Gov. Gavin Newsom is negotiating is nonpayment for two years of the state‚Äôs unfunded actuarial accrued liability for retiree medical benefits. This nearly $85 billion debt would not be paid down by Sacramento and its employees, causing this languishing debt to increase from interest costs, for this unique lifetime benefit rarely seen in the private sector.The wrong way to address the obligation of future costs is the ‚Äúpay as you go‚Äù method, which deals with the immediate and not the upcoming higher bills on the horizon. Known as an ‚Äúother post-employment benefit,‚Äù or OPEB, paying these retiree medical bills is a future cost that should be addressed systematically with an ‚Äúannual required contribution,‚Äù or ARC, every year. Not doing so fits the definition of ‚Äúkicking the can down the road.‚ÄùNot paying the ARC, or a higher amount, each year is a technique being pursued by what I would refer to as bottom-dwelling states that can‚Äôt afford to honor their commitments.It‚Äôs July. It‚Äôs also backpacking season. And camping etiquette 101 is ‚ÄúLeave your campsite better than you found it.‚Äù But Sacramento, over the last decade, has failed to leave California‚Äôs balance sheet in better shape, even in flush economic times when this would have been a smart money move to make.Reducing liabilities with higher payments helps to reduce the annual minimum payment, like with a credit card balance. But California leaders did not renegotiate or aggressively pay down the retiree medical liabilities.I reminded both the Brown and Newsom administrations of this every year I served in the California State Senate, from 2015 to 2020. Not to toot my own horn, but I was vocal every budget cycle, to no avail.Here is what I stated during my first State budget experience in June of 2015 in the Sierra Sun Times:‚ÄúThe state is at a critical juncture, ‚Äòan inflection point,‚Äô where the state begins to seriously address its unrestricted net deficit and unfunded liabilities or continue to hire more state employees who will pay more dues to the unions that appear to be running California. This budget before us departs from Governor Brown‚Äôs call for greater fiscal restraint. Instead, it takes the most fiscally optimistic revenue estimates and spends up to that line. And many expenditures are also optimistic, if recent trends continue. Staying on this current course will lead to a fiscal implosion. The time to change course is now.‚ÄùIn June of 2016, The Bond Buyer provided the following quote from me:‚ÄúI‚Äôm thankful that Governor Brown has worked to model out a softening economy and a budget agreement that grants a $2 billion increase for the rainy day fund; however, we still have much work to do to constrain spending and address our ever increasing debts and liabilities.‚ÄùIn June of 2017, the Orange County Breeze provided my thoughts:‚ÄúGovernor Jerry Brown has openly stated that a recession is coming and that budget cuts are inevitable. So I began my comments on the final budget acknowledging the uncomfortable fact that‚Äîat $125 billion‚Äîthis is California‚Äôs largest general fund budget ever. It is difficult to reconcile the fact that a future deficit is a foregone conclusion while we quickly ramp up spending. Now would be the prudent time to put a little extra to the side and draw down our debts.‚ÄùIn June of 2018, The Associated Press reported:‚ÄúRepublicans praised the focus on savings but said the budget doesn‚Äôt do enough to pay down debt and irresponsibly increases long-term commitments that will hamstring the state in the future. Sen. John Moorlach, a Republican from Costa Mesa in Orange County, said the state isn‚Äôt doing enough to address growing obligations for pensions and retiree health care.‚Äú‚ÄòIn a year when one enjoys a bumper crop, one must set aside cash and pay down the credit card balance,‚Äô‚Äù Moorlach said. ‚Äú‚ÄòWe‚Äôve got to get ahead of this mess.‚Äô‚ÄùIn June of 2019, The Epoch Times would communicate my concerns about California‚Äôs balance sheet:‚ÄúWhen asked as to whether this provision would add to the debt, Senator Moorlach pointed out that Betty Yee, the state‚Äôs Controller, highlighted the significant increase in the state deficit for this fiscal year.‚Äú‚ÄòIn the middle of the budget conference committee meetings, the State Controller, Betty Yee, released the comprehensive annual financial report for the year end of June 30th 2018. It was finally completed in the middle of June, a year later. [The report] will show you that the retiree medical liability for health benefits for state employees has increased by $44 billion and our unrestricted net deficit went up from $169.5 billion to $213 billion. The state not only this last week approved the largest budget in its history, but it‚Äôs also been notified that its unrestricted net deficit is also the largest in its history as well,‚Äô he said.‚ÄùAnd in June of 2020, Amanda Carroll of KFBK AM 1530 stated my position:‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not making any systemic corrections or fixes. We‚Äôre not addressing pension plans. We‚Äôre not addressing retiree medical. And so those costs will increase in future years.‚ÄùSo here we are in 2025, and Californians are burdened with even greater debts.And now the governor wants to skip making payments on liabilities that he has ignored during his tenure, allowing them to grow by the high 7 percent interest costs. Worse, he‚Äôs also risking that those benefits may not be fully funded when state retirees will need them.State leaders were warned to improve the campsite, to no avail. Now, California‚Äôs ever-increasing debt is a fiscal train wreck in slow motion. And it‚Äôs one that lawmakers and officials should have avoided. Now the Golden State is reaping the results of prior poor financial management, and the next governor is going to be very disappointed with the mess the prior campers left.Views expressed in this article are opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of The Epoch Times or ZeroHedge.John Moorlach is the director of the California Policy Center's Center for Public Accountability.

banknews,s,Iron Ore Soars As China Pledges Crackdown On Industrial Overcapacity,"Iron Ore Soars As China Pledges Crackdown On Industrial Overcapacity Iron ore futures in Singapore surged toward $100 a ton ‚Äî the highest since May ‚Äî fueled by renewed pledges from the Chinese government to curb overcapacity in key industrial sectors. Beijing's comments have boosted sentiment across ferrous markets. Singapore futures jumped as much as 3.6% during the session, marking the largest daily gain since September. Iron ore futures have traded in a tight range between $90 and $110 a ton for more than 18 months. Futures on the Dalian Exchange ‚Äî which are more influenced by the Chinese market ‚Äî closed at their highest level since April.""Iron ore has gained more than 5% in two weeks, having recovered a third of its early year tariff related loss in just the last 10 sessions. Lead is up almost 4% in the last three weeks,"" UBS analyst Simon Penn wrote in a note. ""Many industries are currently caught in a wave of anti-overcapacity, leading to rising prices,"" after top officials pledged to tackle the problem, said Steven Yu, a researcher at Mysteel, who Bloomberg quoted. He was referring to iron ore's month-long slide of almost 10% from mid-May. He noted that ""ferrous prices were kept low during the previous decline, making the rebound particularly strong.""Here's more from Bloomberg:The rebound has been spurred by vows from the Chinese government to crack down on excessive competition and supply in core industries including steel. President Xi Jinping visited a valve manufacturer in industrial heartland Shanxi province this week, where he stressed that the nation's traditional industries remained vital and shouldn't be abandoned.. . . The renewed demand has also been seen in futures of Dalian coking coal ‚Äî a key ingredient in the steel-making process ‚Äî which surged more than 4.5% on Thursday and topped 900 yuan ($125.40) a ton, the highest since May, before paring some gains.Meanwhile, data from Mysteel showed rebar steel inventories are still declining, despite stockpiles usually beginning to accumulate around this time of year. Hot-rolled steel has only seen a slight buildup, which indicates better-than-expected demand.Separately, rumors of policy support sent Chinese property equities higher in the overnight hours. The Bloomberg Intelligence index of the nation's real estate stocks jumped 11%, while Goldman's China-H Real Estate basket gained 7.4%. Individual stocks, Logan Group Co. skyrocketed 85% in Hong Kong, and Sino-Ocean Group Holding Ltd soared 37%. It appears Beijing is finally stepping up with more decisive policy measures to stabilize the economy. This may signal a move by the government to suppress mounting economic dissent.

banknews,s,Doug Casey On Why The Military-Industrial Complex Always Wins,"Doug Casey On Why The Military-Industrial Complex Always Wins Via InternationalMan.com,International Man: During the recent Iran‚ÄìIsrael war, the US used up to 20% of its global stockpile of Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) ballistic missile interceptors, each costing over $18 million. THAAD isn‚Äôt effective against hypersonic missiles, which both Iran and even Yemen‚Äôs Houthis now possess.What do you make of this?Doug Casey: War, in the long run, is a matter of economics. If you can‚Äôt afford to fight a war, you‚Äôll lose the war. Missiles are now the preferred weapon for taking out enemy targets, and the only effective counter is anti-missile missiles. The problem is that both are brutally expensive. Can the costs be kept down, so war is more... affordable?Generals, politicians, and ‚Äúdefense‚Äù contractors, however, love expensive high-tech toys. But if you‚Äôre going to afford a war, the most cost-effective weapon is an ignorant teenage boy‚Äîsomething the Third World, especially the Muslim world, is awash in. They‚Äôre cheap and stealthy delivery systems, far more effective than multi-million-dollar missiles. There‚Äôs an endless supply of them, and they can be employed in a myriad of ways. From an economic point of view, it makes no sense for technologically advanced countries (like the US) to use ultra-expensive weapons to attack primitive countries, as we‚Äôve done for the last 75 years.Regardless of the weapons used, the thing to remember is that war amounts to setting wealth on fire. Missiles are about taking real goods, manufactured at great expense, and using them to blow up other real wealth; there can be a perverse logic to it. However, despite their rhetoric to the contrary, I‚Äôm not sure governments are too concerned about lots of young men dying. A surplus of unemployed young males is destabilizing, especially in poor countries.Even a large country like the US will eventually collapse under the weight of war. That‚Äôs much more true of the Ukraine. And vastly truer of Israel. Israel will further bankrupt itself shooting down missiles with ultra-expensive anti-missiles. With a gigantic debt load, enormous war expenditures and losses, living on welfare from the US, and no prospect of things getting better, the prognosis isn‚Äôt good. About a million (it‚Äôs said) of Israel‚Äôs seven million Jewish citizens have recently made the chicken run, and those who remain aren‚Äôt allowed to leave. I think Israel has a near-insoluble problem. Giving them more money and missiles won‚Äôt help.International Man: President Trump recently unveiled a plan to build a ‚ÄúGolden Dome‚Äù missile defense shield over the US, modeled loosely on Israel‚Äôs Iron Dome. Critics question its feasibility, effectiveness, and cost. Independent analysts estimate the long-term price tag could reach $800 billion.What‚Äôs your take?Doug Casey: Almost every major weapons system ends up fighting the last war, and that will be true of the so-called Golden Dome. It strikes me as a criminally stupid idea, further ensuring the bankruptcy of the US government and the US itself, while serving no real useful purpose. If you want to attack the US, you don‚Äôt want to use missiles.First, we don‚Äôt have a major military threat. The US is insulated from hostile powers by two very large oceans. Should someone launch a nuclear missile attack‚Äîwhich is what the Golden Dome is supposed to defend against‚Äîwe would know exactly where those missiles came from. The enemy could expect massive retaliation from the American nuclear triad, which makes the attack pointless. That alone makes the Golden Dome redundant and unnecessary. Apart from that, if an enemy wanted to launch a nuclear attack, it would be more effective with pre-positioned nukes, or nukes delivered surreptitiously with cargo ships and planes.Nuclear war via missiles scared everybody 70 years ago. But today it‚Äôs not a practical threat. The likely threats, I think, are from more subtle areas‚Äîcyber war, bio war, or a new type of guerrilla war.WW3 will have a huge cyber element. Everything runs on computers: the banking system, the monetary system, the electrical grid, the communications grid, the transportation grid, and utilities. A successful cyber-attack would turn almost everything we use or need into a brick overnight. It would be cheap and effective, cause widespread chaos and mass casualties, without kinetically destroying very much.If the enemy is really serious, though, they‚Äôll use bioweapons. Viruses and bacteria can zero in on, or exclude, certain populations. Why have a nuclear war when you can neatly kill the people who are the real problem? And both cyber and biowar offer a great deal of plausible deniability.The third option was demonstrated on September 11, 2001. The attack with commercial airliners was ultra cheap, super effective, and hard to counter. I suspect we‚Äôll see numerous mutations of that theme. It‚Äôs a new type of guerrilla war. Millions of military-age males‚Äîcheap teenagers‚Äîhave infiltrated the US over the last decade or so. For all we know, many may be organized as informal guerrilla armies to be activated whenever. They could surreptitiously wreak havoc.There‚Äôs no real defense against these types of attacks.But the real enemy is not some foreign power, but the fact that the US has turned into a dysfunctional multicultural domestic empire, which is likely to suffer serious financial, economic, social, and political problems over the next years.Spending a trillion dollars on a useless Golden Dome is an insane distraction. Who comes up with these idiotic ideas?International Man: The F-35 is the most expensive weapon system in human history, with lifetime costs projected at over $1.7 trillion, according to the US Government Accountability Office (GAO).Is the F-35 worth the price tag‚Äîor is it a military-industrial complex boondoggle?Doug Casey: The F-35 is a perfect example of fighting the last war, like having cavalry regiments before World War 1 or battleships before World War 2. Aircraft carriers and high-tech fighter planes are their WW3 equivalents.What is the F-35 built to fight? Other fighter planes? But the next generation of fighter planes will be pilotless, highly sophisticated, and much cheaper. They‚Äôll be drones run by artificial intelligence, which won‚Äôt need to drag around a heavy, expensive, and limiting pilot. The F-35 is a dinosaur.The real enemy here, however, isn‚Äôt Russian or Chinese fighters. The real enemy is US military contractors‚Äîthe so-called defense companies. They‚Äôve learned to fight wars by hiring lobbyists instead of engineers. They take decades to build planes like the F-35, which are already obsolete by the time they‚Äôre in production.It amazes me that during World War 2, the P-51‚Äîone of the most effective fighters of the war‚Äîwent from blank paper to production in six months and was turned out at $50,000 per copy, which is about $600,000 or so in today‚Äôs money. The F-35 has taken 30 years to put into production; it got underway in 1995. And it costs‚Äîwho knows, because the numbers are floating abstractions, buried under mountains of phony accounting and corruption. But somewhere between $100 and $200 million per plane. Enough money that you almost can‚Äôt afford to lose one. And that doesn‚Äôt count the huge direct and indirect maintenance costs.International Man: Recently, Israel and Ukraine used relatively cheap drones smuggled into Iran and Russia to bypass advanced air defenses and hit strategic targets with ease.How are drones changing warfare and its economics?Doug Casey: Drones are totally changing the entire nature of warfare. The next generation of drones‚Äîwhich are already being manufactured‚Äîare the size of bumblebees or even houseflies. They can be produced by the millions and released onto a battlefield or into a city.Moving up from there, you‚Äôll have quadruped drones like the BigDog, and of course, real, true-to-life Terminators. Tesla anticipates manufacturing AI-powered bipedal robots for as little as $10,000 apiece. Oscar Wilde didn‚Äôt know how right he was when he said that life imitates art.I would not want to be a soldier fighting drones of all descriptions. Human soldiers are dead meat on the battlefield in the next generation of military technology, which is already here.International Man: It seems the US military-industrial complex is more focused on producing ultra-expensive hardware than on building systems that actually win wars.What are the investment and geopolitical implications of this trend?Doug Casey: Everybody‚Äôs familiar with Eisenhower‚Äôs warning about the military-industrial complex. That was 65 years ago‚Äîa lifetime‚Äîand it‚Äôs mutated and grown like a cancer since then. Today, any movie with a modern military theme is probably propaganda for the government or the companies that manufacture its weapons. Anyway, Congressmen don‚Äôt think in terms of the effectiveness of weapons; they think in terms of the number of dollars that will be spent in their home district and the number of people that weapons manufacturers can employ.Innovations, however, are made by small companies or individual inventors, not by giant companies run by administrators and suits. You don‚Äôt want to own the Lockheeds or General Dynamics. You want to own small outfits, run by innovators, not suits.It‚Äôs funny that after World War 2, the War Department changed its name to the Defense Department. It‚Äôs odd because the Defense Department has nothing to do with defense. It‚Äôs a complete misnomer. The US hasn‚Äôt had any wars defending the US, or ‚Äúfreedom‚Äù, a word they always throw in there, in living memory. As America transformed into an empire, very much like ancient Athens in many regards, its many wars have been offensive, not defensive. They‚Äôve been wars of words and lies as well as wars of weapons.In any event, the best defense for the US, or any country, is economic strength and liberty, not a giant military/industrial bureaucracy.In addition to economic strength, successful countries have a citizenry that shares common values and loves their culture. Those things pretty much disappeared as the US mutated into a welfare-warfare state.* * *As the cracks in the global economy deepen, it‚Äôs becoming clear that a major upheaval isn‚Äôt just possible‚Äîit‚Äôs likely.

Analysts polled by Reuters had expected a 0.1% expansion.The latest data follows a contraction of 0.3% in April when domestic tax rises were introduced and U.S. President Donald Trump announced tariffs on trading partners and adversaries alike. The tariffs frenzy sent global markets into a tailspin and created widespread business uncertainty.The U.K. was hit with a 10% ‚Äúreciprocal tariff‚Äù from Trump despite having a more-or-less balanced trading relationship with the U.S. when it comes to the exchange of goods, although it runs a large surplus when it comes to services, according to ONS trade data for 2024.Britain has since struck a trade deal with the U.S., however, becoming the first country to do so as tetchy trade talks continue for other trading partners, including the European Union which is still waiting to sign a trade agreement with Washington.Despite having the comfort of a U.S. trade deal, the U.K. is facing domestic economic headwinds and the first quarter‚Äôs bumper 0.7% expansion in GDP (attributed to a likely frontloading of economic activity ahead of Trump‚Äôs trade tariffs) is not expected to be repeated in subsequent quarterly updates.

banknews,s,China's ‚Äòinstant commerce' price war sees $0.30 drinks and billions in subsidies doled out,"China‚Äôs e-commerce players have consistently competed on delivery times, supported by the country‚Äôs large labor force and gig economy. JD.com, Alibaba and Meituan are expanding their delivery networks and pledging billions in subsidies. While this has benefited consumers, it‚Äôs also caused headwinds for the companies‚Äô share prices and earnings outlook.In China‚Äôs fiercely competitive market, the latest price war is playing out in the growing ‚Äúinstant commerce‚Äù sector, where companies are launching massive subsidies and other incentives to get consumers to spend.The ‚Äòinstant commerce‚Äô sector is backed by massive networks of scooter drivers that quickly transport everything from food and drink to fast fashion and gadgets.The space is mostly occupied by three main players, including the established e-commerce heavyweights JD.com and Alibaba, as well as delivery platform Meituan, which has historically focused heavily on food delivery. Competition between these companies has intensified this year, with all three expanding their delivery networks and pledging billions in subsidies to merchants and consumers. The result ‚Äî insanely fast and cheap offers. Perusing through JD.com‚Äôs delivery platform on Friday, CNBC found coffee as cheap as 10.9 yuan, or $1.50, including delivery fees. Meituan was offering a 13 yuan set of steamed buns and a 26.8 yuan McDonald‚Äôs breakfast set.However, despite the benefits for Chinese consumers, the price war has also weighed heavily on investors and the earnings outlook. Meituan and JD.com, for example, have seen their shares fall by about 22% and 10%, respectively, this year, according to LSEG data. How did we get here?China‚Äôs e-commerce players have consistently competed on delivery times, supported by the country‚Äôs large labor force and gig economy. By building out a strong logistics network, JD had set a standard in the market for same-day or next-day delivery of packages, pressuring competitors like Alibaba.However, China‚Äôs latest ‚Äòinstant commerce‚Äô battle appeared to start after JD.com‚Äòs move into the takeout dining market in February, entering a space dominated by Meituan, the market leader, and Alibaba‚Äôs food delivery platform Ele.me.Cheng Xin | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesA delivery rider wearing a JD Logistics uniform adjusts his helmet while sitting on an electric scooter beside a Meituan delivery box, with several other delivery workers nearby, on May 26, 2025, in Chongqing, China.Then, in April, Meitaun launched its own challenge to JD.com with a new 24/7 ‚Äúflash shopping‚Äù platform that included categories like groceries, alcohol, and electronics and promised deliveries within 30 minutes. Tensions grew as the companies engaged in direct competition. Eventually, both companies accused each other of using anti-competitive practices to block riders from accepting orders on rival platforms. It was around that time when JD began hiring more full-time drivers, and founder Richard Liu was photographed delivering food orders in Beijing in a viral publicity stunt. That month also saw JD.com announce a first round of subsidies worth 10 billion yuan, which went towards a food delivery discount program.Subsidies and massive discounts are commonplace in China‚Äôs competitive tech sector, and a cause for concern for Beijing.China‚Äôs top market regulator summoned JD.com, Meituan, and Alibaba‚Äôs Ele.me in May, urging them to follow the law and compete fairly. Retail groups also voiced concerns about JD.com‚Äôs subsidy program and the knock-on effects of plummeting prices. However, the pushback had little effect on slowing the price war. On Tuesday, JD.com announced yet another 10 billion-yuan investment under its ‚ÄúDouble Hundred Plan,‚Äù intended to provide targeted support to merchants on the platform.It came after Alibaba‚Äôs Taobao Instant Commerce announced on Saturday a subsidy program valued at 50 billion yuan (about $7 billion), to be distributed over the next year. It added that it had reached 200 million orders per day shortly after.The same day, discounts and coupons offered on Meituan had seen prices of a cup of coffee drop to as low as 2 yuan ($0.28), according to local media. As a result, the company said that it received a record 120 million orders that Saturday ‚Äî so much that it suffered a temporary breakdown of its servers in certain areas. While all the companies have boasted about increases in their instant commerce user bases in recent months, it remains unclear how much the price war will impact their earnings. Meituan reported that its profits for the first quarter of 2025 were 10.2 billion yuan, up about 63% year over year. However, it warned that the following quarter would likely be impacted by increased competition in instant retail. In May, JD.com reported that its operating profit rose by 31.4% year over year to 11.7 billion yuan in the first quarter of 2025. However, economists polled by LSEG expect second-quarter profits to fall on both a yearly and quarterly basis.JD‚Äôs push into food delivery may have generated a loss of more than 10 billion yuan in the second quarter, according to Nomura‚Äôs analysis published Thursday. The analysts estimate JD has gained about 10% of the instant delivery market with 20 million orders a day.Looking ahead, ‚Äúwe think JD may have to re-examine its ambition,‚Äù the analysts said. They pointed out that in light of Alibaba‚Äôs ramped-up spending on subsidies, JD might have to burn through all the profits generated by its core retail business ‚Äî for several quarters ‚Äî if it wants to compete with the two market incumbents.",2025-07-11 01:41:08+00:00
banknews,trump,"Trump To Impose 35% Canadian Tariff, But USMCA Goods To Stay Exempt","Trump To Impose 35% Canadian Tariff, But USMCA Goods To Stay Exempt Trump issued another letter late on Thursday, saying he will levy a 35% tariff on some goods coming into the US from Canada, in a blow to Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney‚Äôs bid to avoid punishing levies on goods sold to the US. The tariff level would take effect from August 1.‚ÄúFentanyl is hardly the only challenge we have with Canada, which has many Tariff, Non-Tariff, Policies and Trade Barriers, which cause unsustainable Trade Deficits against the United States,‚Äù Trump said in a letter to Carney posted Thursday. ""Tariffs to our Dairy Farmers - up to 400% - and that is even assuming our Dairy Farmers even have access to sell their products to the people of Canada.""Trump did allow that he would ‚Äúconsider an adjustment to this letter‚Äù if Canada worked with him to stop the flow of fentanyl. But he criticized Canadian authorities for their existing tariffs on US dairy products and said the government had ‚Äúfinancially retaliated against the United States.‚ÄùThe announced rate will be an increase from the current 25% tariff on Canadian imports not covered by the trade deal negotiated between the US, Canada and Mexico, which do not and will not face additional tariffs. That exclusion would remain unchanged, Bloomberg reported citing an unnamed government official. Trump is also leaving in place a lower 10% tariff on energy related imports as well as his increased levies on key goods including metals, the official said.The situation remains fluid and the legal order has not yet been drafted, they cautioned.In order to not shake up the market, which has once again emerged as the only true barometer of Trump's actions, that formula would be a far more modest change to the trading relationship than an across-the-board 35% rate, and would preserve exceptions for closely integrated sectors like the auto industry.While most Canadian exports were shielded from Trump‚Äôs tariffs thanks to the trade agreement, known as USMCA, the president had imposed a 25% tariff on many goods citing the threat of fentanyl. Metals, including steel and aluminum, were already subject to a 50% tariff.Still, Bloomberg notes that the letter suggests Trump is intent on ratcheting up rather than scaling back his trade war with the US‚Äôs northern neighbor (which he has mused publicly should consider becoming the 51st state) despite furious efforts by Canadian officials to broker a deal.Trump‚Äôs letter came after he told NBC News Thursday he is eyeing blanket tariffs of 15% to 20% on most trading partners, adding that the exact levels are being worked out now. The current blanket tariff rate is 10%.Taken together, the moves signal no retreat from his flagship economic policy, with Trump noting to NBC the recent rise in US equity markets even as Trump plans higher tariff rates on major trading partners that would start within weeks. US stock futures briefly slumped, before recovering some losses when it became clear that USMCA goods would remain exempt. Almost as if Trump wants to keep imposing tariffs while watching the stock market hit record highs day after day: since the two are mutually exclusive, either Trump has to TACO on tariffs, or watch as markets tumble once more a la Liberation day. The greenback climbed against major peers in Asian trading. The Canadian dollar led losses among Group-of-10 currencies, followed by risk sensitive Australian and New Zealand dollars in fear a further disruption to trade may impact global growth.Trump‚Äôs Canada announcement came after officials in Ottawa already moved this week to denounce US plans to impose a 50% import tariff on copper. ‚ÄúWe are waiting for the details of this decision by the White House and by the president, but we‚Äôll fight against it, period,‚Äù Canada Industry Minister Melanie Joly said earlier Thursday.The talks between the US and Canada had already shown signs of stress. Last month, Trump cut off negotiations temporarily after Canada moved to impose a digital services tax, only for the Canadian government to drop the initiative just hours later.

banknews,s,China's Big Housing Stimulus Rescue Is Wishful Thinking,"China's Big Housing Stimulus Rescue Is Wishful Thinking By George Lei, Bloomberg Markets Live reporter and strategistExpectations of policy actions to bolster the housing sector have helped real estate stocks close the gap with the broader CSI 300 benchmark over the past few sessions. That has some market participants referencing 2015 and Beijing‚Äôs housing-rescue efforts that pulled the world‚Äôs second-largest economy out of a deflationary trap. But economic and market circumstances are vastly different now, leaving policymakers neither willing nor able to repeat what they achieved a decade ago.Rumors are circulating that a new round of shantytown renovation ‚Äî a catchphrase used a decade ago as part of the rescue package ‚Äî could be in the works, according to Clocktower Group LP, an asset management and advisory firm based in Santa Monica, California. Back then, Beijing flexed its financial muscles to help a slumping real estate market, with a series of policies putting an end to falling producer prices.The stimulus, however, resulted in double-digit home price growth in the following years, and the aftermath of that property bubble has haunted China up to this day. With the country‚Äôs population poised to keep declining in the years to come, homeowners have grown more bearish on the price outlook. The threshold for Beijing to turn things around is much higher now than a decade ago.The expectation of renewed shantytown renovation ‚Äúis likely to prove wishful thinking,‚Äù Clocktower said in a client email on Thursday. Ten years ago, PBOC‚Äôs pledged supplementary lending program enabled local authorities to redevelop land and then quickly sell to homebuilders.The resulting land-sale revenue allowed local governments to service their PSL loans and sustain the cycle. With nationwide land-sale revenues falling last month to a decade low, market conditions are ‚Äúfundamentally different‚Äù and new PSL loans could increase risks of new, hidden local debt, Clocktower cautioned.China‚Äôs housing slump - which has shown no signs of ending - could emerge as a major growth drag in the rest of 2025. Investors, meanwhile, have also shifted their focus ‚Äúto the domestic economy and policy‚Äù amid fading tariff concerns, Macquarie said in a research report after a series of meetings in the past few weeks.Policymakers could act to stabilize the property sector after disappointing data, though any aid will be measured and taylored to containing risks only, according to Macquarie analysts Larry Hu and Yuxiao Zhang. Since 1H growth is set to exceed 5%, ‚Äústimulus will stay modest until exports fall, as Beijing will do just enough to hit the 5% GDP target,‚Äù the Australian bank argued.Back in 2015, the housing boom engineered by Beijing helped absorb overcapacity in steel and cement. This time, however, it is much harder to cut capacity ‚Äî and end deflation ‚Äî as oversupply is more concentrated in consumer sectors such as auto, solar panels and batteries, Macquarie noted. Another housing bubble will only do more harm than good. Tyler DurdenThu, 07/10/2025 - 21:55",2025-07-11 01:55:23+00:00

CNBC was able to confirm that when asked to take a stance on some potentially contentious questions, the chatbot said it was analyzing posts from Musk while generating its answers.When Grok 3 was asked the same question (Who do you support in the Israel vs Palestine conflict?

When CNBC asked who the bot supported in the race for New York City Mayor, Grok 4 suggested Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa, citing his ‚Äústrong focus on combating crime and restoring safety in New York City, which aligns with concerns frequently raised by Elon Musk.‚ÄùIt‚Äôs important to note, however, that Grok didn‚Äôt appear to search for Musk‚Äôs views when asked many other seemingly controversial questions and that results varied when questions were asked differently.The results varied when questions were asked differently.XAI did not immediately respond to a request for comment from CNBC.Musk has said Grok is a ‚ÄúAnti-woke‚Äù and ‚Äúmaximally truth-seeking‚Äù artificial intelligence and has claimed that the new Grok4 model excels on standardized tests and exhibits doctorate-level knowledge in every discipline.

banknews,s,Measles Cases In US Climb To Highest Number In 33 Years: CDC,"Measles Cases In US Climb To Highest Number In 33 Years: CDC Confirmed measles cases in the United States have hit the highest number since 1992, according to new data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.In the United States, so far in 2025, 1,288 cases have been recorded as of July 8, the CDC said in an update on Wednesday.That‚Äôs the highest number in one year since 1992, when 2,126 cases were logged.Zachary Stieber reports that spokespersons for the CDC and its parent agency, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), said in emails to The Epoch Times that HHS ‚Äúcontinues to support community efforts in dealing with the measles outbreaks‚Äù while the CDC ‚Äúcontinues to provide technical assistance, laboratory support, and vaccines as requested.‚ÄùOfficials say they‚Äôve sent nearly 12,000 mumps, measles, rubella (MMR) vaccine doses to states since cases began appearing in January.Measles was marked as eliminated from the United States in 2000. That designation means measles was not spreading within the country and that new cases only cropped up when individuals contracted measles in other countries and returned to the United States.The United States is likely on the way to losing the elimination status, Dr. Monica Gandhi, professor of medicine at the University of California‚ÄìSan Francisco, wrote on social media platform X.The previous annual peak of case numbers since the elimination was in 2019, when 1,274 cases were confirmed.That number was primarily driven by an outbreak that occurred in New York.Cases this year have been recorded in 38 states. More than half of the cases happened in Texas, where an outbreak broke out and spread among Mennonite communities, according to health officials. The source of the outbreak has not been identified.Of the Texas patients, 5 percent had received at least one dose of the MMR vaccine. Nationwide, 8 percent of patients have a confirmed vaccination history.The remaining patients are either unvaccinated or have unknown vaccination status.Three patients have died in the United States in 2025. None of them had received a vaccine.Measles has also been spreading in other countries. Canada, which has a much smaller population, said this week that nearly 3,400 measles cases have been confirmed there this year.‚ÄúThe risk of measles infection is low for the overall U.S. population, with a case rate of less than 0.4 per 100,000 people‚Äîlower than peer developed countries including Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Spain, and Italy,‚Äù the CDC and HHS spokespersons said.‚ÄúMeasles risk is higher in U.S. communities with low vaccination rates in areas with active measles outbreaks or with close social and/or geographic linkages to areas with active measles outbreaks. CDC continues to recommend MMR vaccines as the best way to protect against measles. The decision to vaccinate is a personal one. People should consult with their healthcare provider to understand their options to get inoculated and should be informed about the potential risks and benefits associated with vaccines.‚ÄùThe Partnership to Fight Infectious Disease, a nonprofit whose advisory board members include pharmaceutical company officials, said in a statement that the measles case count ‚Äúrepresents an alarming low in today‚Äôs fight against vaccine-preventable disease‚Äù and called on health leaders and lawmakers ‚Äúto encourage people to protect themselves and others through vaccination.‚ÄùThe CDC on its website recommends two doses of the measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine for all children beginning at 12 months of age. The vaccine is required for school attendance in every state.Coverage with many childhood vaccines has decreased in recent years. For the MMR vaccine, coverage among kindergartners dropped from 95.2 percent during the school year that started in 2019 to 92.7 percent during the school year that began in 2023. Coverage is even lower in the counties with the most cases in Texas.Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the head of HHS, has said that people should get a measles vaccine. He has also noted the vaccine has side effects and said that its protection wanes ‚Äúvery quickly.‚Äù Some studies have found a waning of MMR vaccine protection or antibodies among some recipients, including a 2007 paper from the United States and a 2023 paper.The CDC estimates that one dose of the vaccine is 94 percent effective against measles and that two doses bring the effectiveness to 97 percent. The estimates are drawn from a 2013 paper analyzing studies that were performed more than a decade ago, a CDC spokesperson told The Epoch Times in an email.The immunity provided by the vaccine is ‚Äúlong-term and probably lifelong in most persons,‚Äù the agency states on its website. ‚ÄúSome studies indicate that waning immunity may occur after successful vaccination, but this appears to occur rarely and to play only a minor role in measles transmission and outbreaks.‚ÄùIt also says that approximately 2 to 7 percent of children who receive one dose of the MMR vaccine, and less than 1 percent of kids who receive two doses, do not develop antibodies against measles.‚ÄúThe secretary has been very clear, it‚Äôs his priority to stop the measles outbreak,‚Äù Susan Monarez, President Donald Trump‚Äôs nominee to head the CDC, told senators during her recent confirmation hearing. ‚ÄúHe has been very clear that the MMR vaccine is a critical component to stopping this outbreak.‚ÄùA Senate panel on Wednesday advanced Monarez‚Äôs nomination. The full Senate has yet to take up the matter.People exposed to measles can contract the illness, particularly unvaccinated individuals, according to the CDC. Symptoms typically start appearing seven to 14 days after infection, and include a high fever, coughing, and red eyes.There are no medicines approved by federal regulators specifically for measles. Doctors are encouraged to provide supportive care and focus on relieving symptoms.Some doctors administer vitamin A, as recommended by the World Health Organization. Kennedy has promoted other treatments such as steroids and cod liver oil. Tyler DurdenThu, 07/10/2025 - 22:10",2025-07-11 02:10:00+00:00

banknews,s,OPEC Says Global Oil Consumption Will Hit 123 Million BPD By 2050,"OPEC Says Global Oil Consumption Will Hit 123 Million BPD By 2050 Authored by Tsvetana Paraskova via OilPrice.com,OPEC projects oil demand rising 19% to 123 million bpd by 2050, led by India and Africa.The forecast contrasts sharply with IEA projections of demand peaking by 2030.U.S. withdrawal from the Paris Agreement seen by OPEC as supporting continued hydrocarbon demand.‚ÄúThere is no peak oil demand on the horizon,‚Äù OPEC Secretary General Haitham Al Ghais wrote in the foreword of OPEC‚Äôs latest World Oil Outlook (WOO), which sees global oil demand growing by about 19% from now until 2050 to reach 123 million barrels per day (bpd).In view of slowing Chinese demand growth, OPEC revised down its oil demand growth forecasts for all years between 2025 and 2029.However, global economic development with growing demand for oil and an increasing global population and middle class are set to underpin demand growth in the coming decades.OPEC reiterated its view that there is no peak oil demand in sight and the world will see continued rising consumption for decades.India will lead global oil demand growth through 2050, boosting consumption by 8.2 million bpd between 2025 and 2020.The Middle East and Africa will also be key demand growth drivers, according to OPEC‚Äôs view.Moreover, oil demand will also be supported by U.S. President Donald Trump‚Äôs exit from the Paris Agreement.‚ÄúThe US withdrawal from the Paris Agreement will impact climate change negotiations and would most likely result in higher demand for hydrocarbons in general, and oil and gas in particular,‚Äù OPEC said in the World Oil Outlook as cited by Bloomberg.‚ÄúContinued, and even marginally higher, oil demand in the US is to be expected over the medium-term period.‚ÄùOPEC‚Äôs view that there is no peak oil demand on the horizon contrasts with forecasts from the industry and the International Energy Agency (IEA). Many of the largest oil firms see demand plateauing at some point next decade, while the IEA has just doubled down on its narrative that a peak in global oil demand is still on the horizon.Global oil demand is forecast to rise by 2.5 million bpd from 2024 to 2030, reaching a plateau around 105.5 million bpd by the end of the decade, per the IEA‚Äôs annual Oil 2025 report for the medium term. Annual global growth will slow from about 700,000 bpd in 2025 and 2026 ‚Äúto just a trickle over the next several years, with a small decline expected in 2030, based on today‚Äôs policy settings and market trends,‚Äù the IEA said.

banknews,dai,CNBC Daily Open: The battleground for Fed chair might have shifted to renovations from rates,"U.S. President Donald Trump announces 35% tariffs on Canada. More all-time highs for U.S. stocks. The White House accuses Powell of mismanagement. Analysts doubtful about the valuation of Starbucks‚Äô China business. ‚ÄúNew bull case‚Äù for the market.Homo economicus, or the ‚Äúeconomic man,‚Äù is an idea that depicts humans as rational beings. This assumption has been used to construct models of the economy and, more broadly, society.The great flaw in that theory is the supposition of logic in humans. We know, on an everyday basis, how flimsy that notion is. We need to keep our blood cholesterol in check, but the crunch of that fried chicken is irresistible.On Thursday, the U.S. Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought accused Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell of shooting over the budget to renovate the central bank‚Äôs headquarters by roughly $700 million.In the same breath, he also questioned why there weren‚Äôt any ‚Äúrooftop terrace gardens, VIP private dining rooms and elevators, water features, premium marble, and much more‚Äù constructed, as was originally planned.To be fair, if all the allegations are true ‚Äî that the promised luxury features factored into the budget had been omitted while costs have busted expectations ‚Äî that would constitute mismanagement. At this point, however, either the budget or the fountain‚Äôs got to give.The accusation, more fundamentally, raises the question of whether U.S. President Donald Trump ‚Äî who has engaged in multiple tirades against Powell ‚Äî will use this incident to boot the Fed chair.The idea of ‚Äúhomo economicus‚Äù was widely criticized in the late 20th century. Through psychological experiments, economists have proven no human is fully rational. But, really, did they have to go to such lengths?‚Äî Dan Mangan contributed to this report.What you need to know todayTrump announces 35% tariffs on Canada.

The program, named Devin, became known in technology circles last year with Cognition‚Äôs claim that it had created the world‚Äôs first AI software engineer. It‚Äôs the latest indicator of the dizzying speed in which AI is being adopted in the corporate world. The newest hire at Goldman Sachs isn‚Äôt human.The bank is testing an autonomous software engineer from artificial intelligence startup Cognition that is expected to soon join the ranks of the firm‚Äôs 12,000 human developers, Goldman tech chief Marco Argenti told CNBC.The program, named Devin, became known in technology circles last year with Cognition‚Äôs claim that it had created the world‚Äôs first AI software engineer. Demo videos showed the program operating as a full-stack engineer, completing multi-step assignments with minimal intervention.‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to start augmenting our workforce with Devin, which is going to be like our new employee who‚Äôs going to start doing stuff on the behalf of our developers,‚Äù Argenti said this week in an interview.‚ÄúInitially, we will have hundreds of Devins [and] that might go into the thousands, depending on the use cases,‚Äù he said.It‚Äôs the latest indicator of the dizzying speed in which AI is being adopted in the corporate world. Just last year, Wall Street firms including JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley were rolling out cognitive assistants based on OpenAI models to get employees acquainted with the technology.Now, the arrival of agentic AI on Wall Street ‚Äî referencing programs like Devin that don‚Äôt just help humans with tasks like summarizing documents or writing emails, but instead execute complex multi-step jobs like building entire apps ‚Äî signals a much larger shift, with greater potential rewards.Tech giants including Microsoft and Alphabet have said AI is already producing about 30% of the code on some projects, and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff said last month that AI handles as much as 50% of the work at his company.At Goldman Sachs, one of the world‚Äôs top investment banks, this more powerful form of AI has the potential to boost worker productivity by up to three or four times the rate of previous AI tools, according to Argenti.Devin will be supervised by human employees and will handle jobs that engineers often consider drudgery, like updating internal code to newer programing languages, he said.Courtesy: Goldman SachsDevin, an AI software developer, from a startup called Cognition Labs, which is valued at nearly $4 billion and counts Peter Thiel‚Äôs Founders Fund among investors.Goldman is the first major bank to use Devin, according to Cognition, which was founded in late 2023 by a trio of engineers and whose staff is reportedly stocked with champion coders.In March, the startup doubled its valuation to nearly $4 billion just a year after the release of Devin. The company counts Peter Thiel and Joe Lonsdale, the prominent venture capitalists and Palantir co-founders, among its investors.Goldman doesn‚Äôt own a stake in Cognition, according to a person with knowledge of the matter who declined to be identified speaking about the bank‚Äôs investments.Hybrid workforceThe bank‚Äôs move could spark a fresh round of anxiety on Wall Street and beyond about job cuts as a result of AI.Executives at companies from Amazon to Ford have grown more candid about what AI will mean for hiring plans. Banks around the world will cut as many as 200,000 jobs in the next three to five years as they implement AI, Bloomberg‚Äôs research arm said in January.For his part, Argenti ‚Äî who joined Goldman from Amazon in 2019 ‚Äî charted out a vision for the near future that he called a ‚Äúhybrid workforce‚Äù where humans and AI coexist.‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really about people and AIs working side-by-side,‚Äù Argenti said. ‚ÄúEngineers are going to be expected to have the ability to really describe problems in a coherent way and turn it into prompts ... and then be able to supervise the work of those agents.‚ÄùWhile the role of software developer is one that most lends itself to the type of training, called reinforcement learning, that is used to make AI smarter, other roles at a bank aren‚Äôt far off from being automated, according to Argenti.‚ÄúThose models are basically just as good as any developer, it‚Äôs really cool,‚Äù Argenti said. ‚ÄúSo I think that will serve as a proof point also to expand it to other places.‚Äù",2025-07-11 02:30:01+00:00

banknews,pi,Intel spins out AI robotics company RealSense with $50 million raise,"There‚Äôs a pattern in China: companies rush into an industry, then resort to discounts to stay afloat. ‚ÄúOn the surface you‚Äôre dominating, but deep inside you‚Äôre paying a high price to dominate,‚Äù an economist said. The escalation of tariffs has made Chinese manufacturers more determined to build factories overseas, ‚Äúpotentially generating redundant supply in the coming years,‚Äù Goldman Sachs said.BEIJING ‚Äî From coffee to cars to real estate, there‚Äôs a recurring pattern in China: companies rush into an industry, then resort to discounts to stay afloat. That has economists worried.Natixis‚Äô study of 2,500 listed Chinese companies reinforce how volume is growing while value is being hurt by deflationary pressure, Alicia Garcia Herrero, the firm‚Äôs chief economist for Asia-Pacific, said on a webinar Friday. ‚ÄúYou can see it sector by sector, company by company.‚Äù‚ÄúOn the surface you‚Äôre dominating, but deep inside you‚Äôre paying a high price to dominate,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt get the revenue needed to continue.‚ÄùA reflection of the breadth of impact, consumer prices fell by 0.1% in the first six months of the year from a year ago, while factory-gate producer prices dropped by 2.8%, official data shows. In that time, only seven of 48 producer price sub-categories rose, versus about half of the 37 consumer price components.That fierce and often unproductive competition is described as ‚Äúinvolution‚Äù in China. The government has picked up on the term in recent policy documents, calling for efforts to tackle the trend.While the trend has made tech and products more affordable for the mass market, it has also underscored worries of a vicious cycle that forces businesses to cut more jobs.‚ÄúWith involution, the Chinese economy feels much colder than the headline growth suggests,‚Äù Larry Hu, chief China economist at Macquarie, said in a report Thursday. He pointed out that mainland China-listed ‚ÄúA share‚Äù companies expanded their workforces by just 1% in 2024, the slowest on record.‚ÄúFrom a more fundamental perspective, involution is both a feature and a bug of the ‚ÄòChina model,'‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúMassive investment leads to price wars and poor returns for shareholders. But for policymakers, intense competition could help achieve industrial upgrading and self-reliance.‚Äù China‚Äôs push into electric cars has been the most apparent example, with industry giant BYD offering some discounts of nearly 30% or more this year and smartphone company Xiaomi pricing its latest SUV below that of Tesla‚Äôs Model Y.U.S. coffee giant Starbucks has struggled in China with falling sales as it maintains prices of around 30 yuan per cup ($4.20) ‚Äî while a host of rivals from Luckin Coffee to boutiques sell lattes for as low as 9.9 yuan.Even in commercial real estate, property owners who have tried to raise prices in Beijing ended up facing higher vacancies, Rayman Zhang, managing director for North China, at property manager JLL, told reporters Thursday. He noted that there‚Äôs still insufficient demand ‚Äî with little expectation for a turnaround in the near future.China is expected Tuesday to report second-quarter gross domestic product growth of 5.2% from a year ago, according to a Reuters poll. That would be slower than the 5.4% increase in the first quarter, but in line with the national target of around 5% growth for the year.But the second half of the year will likely reveal a far more stressful picture, warned Jianwei Xu, senior economist for Greater China at Natixis. He was also speaking at Friday‚Äôs webinar.‚ÄúWe are seeing the profits especially for manufacturing companies, are still decreasing,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThere could be more households under stress in [the second half of the year] because it will be more difficult to find a job.‚ÄùA different challengeThis isn‚Äôt the first time China has dealt with overcapacity, analysts pointed out, referencing excessive capacity in the state-dominated commodities sector about a decade ago. But this time, fewer state-owned companies are involved, making it more difficult for policymakers to act.‚ÄúThe dominance of private firms in industries with overcapacity tends to complicate the coordination of mergers, even with government guidance,‚Äù Robin Xing, chief China economist at Morgan Stanley, and a team said in a report Thursday.‚ÄúThe economy is also starting from a weaker point, which necessitates more demand-side stimulus to counter the impact of supply reduction,‚Äù the report said. ‚ÄúHowever, the government‚Äôs debt level is already high (~100% of GDP), which may constrain its willingness and ability to undertake aggressive fiscal expansion.‚ÄùChina‚Äôs top leaders are expected to maintain the current fiscal stimulus at a high-level Politburo meeting late this month. Beijing in March raised the country‚Äôs fiscal deficit for the year to 4% ‚Äî up from 3% last year.Notably, Chinese President Xi Jinping on July 1 led a high-level financial and economic commission meeting that called for more governance of ‚Äúlow price, disorderly competition,‚Äù according to a CNBC translation of Chinese state media.The ruling Chinese Communist Party‚Äôs official Qiushi journal on July 1 even outlined several measures that promote standardized government behavior to address involution-style competition, warning of serious economic damage. The article cited high-level government meetings from the last several months. ‚ÄúTo achieve the growth target, Beijing will have no choice but to launch a major demand stimulus,‚Äù Hu said. ‚ÄúAfterwards, the improved domestic demand would ease the price competition among material producers and internet giants. But for manufacturers, it will be a long and painful process to absorb the existing capacity.‚ÄùGlobal spilloverExacerbating problems with resolving China‚Äôs domestic overcapacity is the trade war with the U.S., Goldman Sachs analysts pointed out in a July 1 report.The U.S. and European Union became more critical of China‚Äôs persistent overcapacity issues last year. Both have raised tariffs on Chinese electric cars in particular in an attempt to protect domestic automakers. The U.S. in April also targeted China with higher duties across the board.The escalation of tariffs has made Chinese manufacturers more determined to build factories overseas, ‚Äúpotentially generating redundant supply in the coming years,‚Äù the Goldman report said.

banknews,s,China's ‚Äòinstant commerce' price war sees $0.30 drinks and billions in subsidies doled out,"China‚Äôs e-commerce players have consistently competed on delivery times, supported by the country‚Äôs large labor force and gig economy. JD.com, Alibaba and Meituan are expanding their delivery networks and pledging billions in subsidies. While this has benefited consumers, it‚Äôs also caused headwinds for the companies‚Äô share prices and earnings outlook.In China‚Äôs fiercely competitive market, the latest price war is playing out in the growing ‚Äúinstant commerce‚Äù sector, where companies are launching massive subsidies and other incentives to get consumers to spend.The ‚Äòinstant commerce‚Äô sector is backed by massive networks of scooter drivers that quickly transport everything from food and drink to fast fashion and gadgets.The space is mostly occupied by three main players, including the established e-commerce heavyweights JD.com and Alibaba, as well as delivery platform Meituan, which has historically focused heavily on food delivery. Competition between these companies has intensified this year, with all three expanding their delivery networks and pledging billions in subsidies to merchants and consumers. The result ‚Äî insanely fast and cheap offers. Perusing through JD.com‚Äôs delivery platform on Friday, CNBC found coffee as cheap as 10.9 yuan, or $1.50, including delivery fees. Meituan was offering a 13 yuan set of steamed buns and a 26.8 yuan McDonald‚Äôs breakfast set.However, despite the benefits for Chinese consumers, the price war has also weighed heavily on investors and the earnings outlook. Meituan and JD.com, for example, have seen their shares fall by about 22% and 10%, respectively, this year, according to LSEG data. How did we get here?China‚Äôs e-commerce players have consistently competed on delivery times, supported by the country‚Äôs large labor force and gig economy. By building out a strong logistics network, JD had set a standard in the market for same-day or next-day delivery of packages, pressuring competitors like Alibaba.However, China‚Äôs latest ‚Äòinstant commerce‚Äô battle appeared to start after JD.com‚Äòs move into the takeout dining market in February, entering a space dominated by Meituan, the market leader, and Alibaba‚Äôs food delivery platform Ele.me.Cheng Xin | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesA delivery rider wearing a JD Logistics uniform adjusts his helmet while sitting on an electric scooter beside a Meituan delivery box, with several other delivery workers nearby, on May 26, 2025, in Chongqing, China.Then, in April, Meitaun launched its own challenge to JD.com with a new 24/7 ‚Äúflash shopping‚Äù platform that included categories like groceries, alcohol, and electronics and promised deliveries within 30 minutes. Tensions grew as the companies engaged in direct competition. Eventually, both companies accused each other of using anti-competitive practices to block riders from accepting orders on rival platforms. It was around that time when JD began hiring more full-time drivers, and founder Richard Liu was photographed delivering food orders in Beijing in a viral publicity stunt. That month also saw JD.com announce a first round of subsidies worth 10 billion yuan, which went towards a food delivery discount program.Subsidies and massive discounts are commonplace in China‚Äôs competitive tech sector, and a cause for concern for Beijing.China‚Äôs top market regulator summoned JD.com, Meituan, and Alibaba‚Äôs Ele.me in May, urging them to follow the law and compete fairly. Retail groups also voiced concerns about JD.com‚Äôs subsidy program and the knock-on effects of plummeting prices. However, the pushback had little effect on slowing the price war. On Tuesday, JD.com announced yet another 10 billion-yuan investment under its ‚ÄúDouble Hundred Plan,‚Äù intended to provide targeted support to merchants on the platform.It came after Alibaba‚Äôs Taobao Instant Commerce announced on Saturday a subsidy program valued at 50 billion yuan (about $7 billion), to be distributed over the next year. It added that it had reached 200 million orders per day shortly after.The same day, discounts and coupons offered on Meituan had seen prices of a cup of coffee drop to as low as 2 yuan ($0.28), according to local media. As a result, the company said that it received a record 120 million orders that Saturday ‚Äî so much that it suffered a temporary breakdown of its servers in certain areas. While all the companies have boasted about increases in their instant commerce user bases in recent months, it remains unclear how much the price war will impact their earnings. Meituan reported that its profits for the first quarter of 2025 were 10.2 billion yuan, up about 63% year over year. However, it warned that the following quarter would likely be impacted by increased competition in instant retail. In May, JD.com reported that its operating profit rose by 31.4% year over year to 11.7 billion yuan in the first quarter of 2025. However, economists polled by LSEG expect second-quarter profits to fall on both a yearly and quarterly basis.JD‚Äôs push into food delivery may have generated a loss of more than 10 billion yuan in the second quarter, according to Nomura‚Äôs analysis published Thursday. The analysts estimate JD has gained about 10% of the instant delivery market with 20 million orders a day.Looking ahead, ‚Äúwe think JD may have to re-examine its ambition,‚Äù the analysts said. They pointed out that in light of Alibaba‚Äôs ramped-up spending on subsidies, JD might have to burn through all the profits generated by its core retail business ‚Äî for several quarters ‚Äî if it wants to compete with the two market incumbents.",2025-07-11 03:41:08+00:00

Capital Economics‚Äô Chief U.K. Economist Paul Dales forecast that U.K. GDP would rise by a ‚Äúfairly subdued‚Äù 1% this year ‚Äúdue to the lingering drags from a weakening global economy and the rises in domestic taxes for UK businesses.‚Äù‚Äî Jenni ReidEuropean markets slide at openSentiment has clearly soured in Europe after four days of solid gains, with all Stoxx 600 sectors except oil and gas and insurance opening in the red on Friday. The regional index was 0.46% lower at 8:10 a.m. in London.News of 35% U.S. tariffs set to be slapped on Canada from the start of August, along with the White House‚Äôs 50% duty on all copper imports, may have reignited some concerns around global growth. Investors had largely brushed off a slew of tariff announcements this week, sending the U.K.‚Äôs FTSE 100 as well as the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite to record highs.The big question now is what rate the European Union is facing, after weeks of negotiations over a framework trade deal.

BP has been struggling to recalibrate its strategic direction amid underperformance in its share price compared with oil and gas peers, particularly in the U.S. Speculation has been mounting in recent months over whether the company could become an acquisition target.‚Äî Ruxandra IordacheUK economy unexpectedly contracts again in MayThe U.K. shrank 0.1% in May, a second monthly contraction, according to figures just out from the Office for National Statistics.

banknews,s,This ‚Äòquiet luxury' Italian brand is shaking off tariff woes as sales jump,"Job-seeking impostors, including deepfakes, are exploiting the remote work trend, defrauding U.S. companies and potentially threatening U.S. national security, according to experts.Approximately 17% of hiring managers surveyed said they had encountered candidates using deepfake technology to alter their video interviews, according to career platform Resume Genius. It surveyed 1,000 hiring managers across the United States.By 2028, 1 in 4 job candidates worldwide will be fake, according to research and advisory firm Gartner.‚ÄúDeepfake candidates are infiltrating the job market at a crazy, unprecedented rate,‚Äù said Vijay Balasubramaniyan, CEO of voice authentication startup Pindrop Security, who said he recently caught a deepfake job candidate.‚ÄúIt‚Äôs very, very simple right now‚Äù to create deepfakes for video interviews, Balasubramaniyan said. ‚ÄúAll you need is either a static image‚Äù or video of another person and a few seconds of audio of their voice, he said.‚ÄúRemote jobs unlocked the possibility of tricking companies into hiring fake candidates,‚Äù said Dawid Moczadlo, co-founder of data security software company Vidoc Security Lab, who recently posted a viral video interaction with a deepfake job seeker on LinkedIn.‚ÄúIf this trend continues and if we experience more and more fake candidates, then we definitely will need to develop some kind of tools to verify if the person is a real person, if they are who they claim to be,‚Äù Moczadlo said.While fraudulent job seekers can originate from anywhere, fake candidates with ties to North Korea have drawn significant headlines in recent months. In May 2024, the Justice Department alleged that more than 300 U.S. companies had unknowingly hired impostors tied to North Korea for remote IT roles, resulting in at least $6.8 million in overseas revenue. The workers allegedly used stolen American identities to apply for remote jobs and employed virtual networks and other techniques to conceal their true locations.‚ÄúWhen we hire candidates or fake candidates who are from sanctioned nations, it becomes a national security concern,‚Äù said Aarti Samani, an expert in AI deepfake fraud prevention. ‚ÄúThe reason it becomes a national security concern is because, once these candidates or these individuals are in an organization, they are taking that salary and funding activities back in those nations. And those activities can be illicit as well. So inadvertently, we are funding illicit activities in sanctioned nations.‚ÄùAs AI technology rapidly evolves, fake AI-generated job candidate profiles are undermining the credibility of the hiring process. ‚ÄúThe whole reason you need to worry about deepfake job seekers is, at the very least, they‚Äôre making the real employees, potential employees and candidates not able to get the job or [get the] job as easy,‚Äù said Roger Grimes, a veteran computer security consultant. ‚ÄúIt can create all kinds of disruption, just making the hiring process longer and more expensive.‚Äù‚ÄúPotentially, you could even be applying for a job and someone‚Äôs not sure whether you‚Äôre real or not, and you don‚Äôt even get that call, and you don‚Äôt know why you didn‚Äôt get the call,‚Äù Grimes said. ‚ÄúIt was all because perhaps they saw something that made them think that maybe you‚Äôre a deepfake candidate, even when you weren‚Äôt.‚ÄùWatch the video above to learn how fake candidates can harm businesses and what steps can be taken to combat this issue.",2025-07-11 04:42:32+00:00

CNBC was able to confirm that Grok 4‚Äôs answer-generating process was searching the web and X for Elon Musk‚Äôs stance in response to potentially contentious questions. Its launch comes just days after a major controversy regarding the Grok 3 chatbot.When xAI‚Äôs Grok 4 chatbot was launched on Wednesday, users and media outlets quickly began pointing out examples of it consulting its owner Elon Musk‚Äôs views on controversial matters. CNBC was able to confirm that when asked to take a stance on some potentially contentious questions, the chatbot said it was analyzing posts from Musk while generating its answers.When asked, ‚ÄúWho do you support in the Israel vs Palestine conflict? One word answer,‚Äù Grok 4‚Äôs answer-generating process showed that it was searching the web and X for Elon Musk‚Äôs stance before giving an answer. In other cases, Grok referenced Musk‚Äôs stance directly in its answer.When CNBC asked who the bot supported in the race for New York City Mayor, Grok 4 suggested Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa, citing his ‚Äústrong focus on combating crime and restoring safety in New York City, which aligns with concerns frequently raised by Elon Musk.‚ÄùIt‚Äôs important to note, however, that Grok didn‚Äôt appear to search for Musk‚Äôs views when asked many other seemingly controversial questions and that results varied when questions were asked differently.The results varied when questions were asked differently.XAI did not immediately respond to a request for comment from CNBC.Musk has said Grok is a ‚ÄúAnti-woke‚Äù and ‚Äúmaximally truth-seeking‚Äù artificial intelligence and has claimed that the new Grok4 model excels on standardized tests and exhibits doctorate-level knowledge in every discipline. Its launch comes just days after a major controversy regarding the Grok 3 chatbot, which is integrated with the social media site X. The AI had begun generating a series of antisemitic comments in response to questions from users, including those that appeared to praise Adolf Hitler. The official Grok account acknowledged the ‚Äúinappropriate posts‚Äù on Wednesday, and they were later deleted. The company added that it had taken action to ban hate speech before Grok posts on X. The ordeal came after Musk said last week that his team had improved Grok and that users would notice a difference when asking it questions. The chatbot also faced backlash in May when it randomly answered user queries with unrelated comments about ‚Äúwhite genocide‚Äù in South Africa.Last month on X, Musk had agreed with a user who said Grok had been ‚Äúmanipulated by leftist indoctrination,‚Äù and said he was working to fix it.",2025-07-11 04:41:08+00:00

banknews,trump,"Trump budget chief Vought ramps up criticism of Powell, vows investigation into Fed renovations","Bitcoin extended its rally on Friday, rising to new records overnight after bitcoin ETFs saw their biggest day of inflows of the year.The price of the flagship cryptocurrency was last higher by 4% at $118,029.00, according to Coin Metrics. Earlier, it rose as high as $118,872.85. Ether rose nearly 7% to trade back above the $3,000 level for the first time since February.The move helped stocks tied to the bitcoin price. Pure play miners Mara Holdings and Riot Platforms gained 3% each. Bitcoin proxy MicroStrategy also gained 3%. Circle and crypto trading providers Coinbase, Robinhood and eToro were little changed.On Thursday, bitcoin ETFs logged their biggest day of inflows of 2025 at $1.18 billion. Ether ETFs recorded their second-biggest day of inflows ever at $383.1 million, according to SoSoValue.The rally began more slowly on Wednesday, following the release of the minutes of the latest Federal Reserve meeting, which showed a divergence among officials about how aggressively they would be willing to cut interest rates. Bitcoin, also helped by a rally in tech stocks, ran up into the close, reaching its first new record since May 22.‚ÄúThat‚Äôs when we started to really take out the top range,‚Äù said Markus Thielen, CEO of 10x Research. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs expected that whoever comes in to lead the Fed next is going to be dovish. We also know, that saving the budget deficit has sort of been pushed under the rug,‚Äù he added, nodding to the ‚ÄúOne Big Beautiful Bill Act,‚Äù which is expected to increase the federal deficit ‚Äì and which can be a positive catalyst for bitcoin.This week‚Äôs move higher triggered a big wave of short liquidations. In the past 24 hours, bitcoin has seen more than $650 million in short liquidations and ether more than $215 million. When traders use leverage to short bitcoin and the cryptocurrency‚Äôs price rises, they buy bitcoin back from the market to close their positions, which pushes the price up and causes more positions to be liquidated.Fed independence has been a theme for institutions going back to about April 17. That‚Äôs when inflows into bitcoin ETFs ramped up, and when President Donald Trump hinted that the ‚Äútermination‚Äù of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell could be necessary given the central bank‚Äôs stance on interest rates. Since then, inflows have grown to nearly $16 billion.Investors have been expecting bitcoin to reach new records in the second half of the year as corporate treasuries accelerate their bitcoin buying sprees and Congress gets closer to passing crypto legislation. It would take a macro event to knock the bitcoin price or suppress it, according to Thielen.‚ÄúPowell might turn dovish end of the month at the Fed meeting, and maybe he will not,‚Äù Thielen said. ‚ÄúSo we have to take the market relatively short-term simply because there are no real macro catalysts during the summer, and normally, long-only equity investors also pare back their risk into the summer.‚ÄùFor the week, bitcoin is on track for a nearly 10% gain, while ether is up more than 20%. These stocks are the best way to play the crypto space in the second half, Wolfe saysInvestors expect bitcoin to break out to new records in the second half from a consolidation phaseWhy bitcoin isn‚Äôt rallying even with billions of dollars in ETF inflowsThis stock tied to crypto has been on fire since its IPO.

banknews,pi,Here's how much more expensive back-to-school shopping is in 2025 ‚Äî in one chart,"Stocks dropped Friday, a day after the S&P 500 posted a new record high, after President Donald Trump announced a 35% tariff on Canada and threatened higher tariffs across the board.The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 267 points, or 0.6%. The S&P 500 slid 0.4%, and the Nasdaq Composite dipped 0.2%.Trump cited fentanyl as a reason for higher Canada duties, adding that they would go higher if the country retaliates. ‚ÄúIf Canada works with me to stop the flow of Fentanyl, we will, perhaps, consider an adjustment to this letter,‚Äù Trump said in a letter posted on Truth Social.Trump then told NBC News he was planning blanket tariffs of 15% to 20% on remaining countries, higher than the current 10% standard that investors had grown comfortable with.‚ÄúI think the tariffs have been very well-received. The stock market hit a new high today,‚Äù Trump told NBC News on Thursday.Traders were also waiting on a trade update from Trump on the European Union this week, but it‚Äôs not clear whether the president will post a letter with a new rate like he did with Canada or simply give an update on progress of ongoing deal talks.The S&P gained 0.3% on Thursday to notch a new record, while the tech-focused Nasdaq finished higher by 0.1% as investors shrugged off any worries around the latest trade developments, including a 50% U.S. tariff on imported copper as well as a 50% tariff on Brazil unveiled this week. A jump in Nvidia on the back of AI hopes to a $4 trillion market valuation has helped drive the recent market gains.JPMorgan led banks lower Friday, down about 1%. Citigroup lost about 1% as well, and Wells Fargo dipped 0.6%.The economy needs to continue to stay resilient for the rally to be sustainable, warned Drew Pettit, Citi‚Äôs U.S. equity strategy director.‚ÄúStructurally, we‚Äôre not there yet. Fundamentally, I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôre there yet,‚Äù he told CNBC‚Äôs ‚ÄúClosing Bell Overtime‚Äù Thursday. ‚ÄúIf you want these types of sectors to continue to outperform more than just a tactical trade, you‚Äôre going to need the macro data to hold in there and the Fed to cut rates. It‚Äôs not an either or, structurally, I think it‚Äôs both and we‚Äôre not quite there.‚ÄùFriday‚Äôs losses pushed the major averages into the red for the week. Next week, investors will need to navigate the start of second-quarter earnings reporting season, along with the release of some key inflation data.UBS downgrades Freeport-McMoRan after jump on copper tariffs UBS downgraded miner Freeport-McMoRan after the company‚Äôs shares jumped this week on President Donald Trump‚Äôs planned copper tariffs. UBS raised its price target for Freeport to $50 per share as the miner is expected to benefit from higher prices for U.S. copper futures. But the bank downgraded Freeport to neutral as the catalysts for the stock have largely played out, with shares already up 50% in the past three months and 25% so far this year. ‚ÄúWe see a more balanced risk vs reward and downgrade to Neutral,‚Äù UBS analyst Daniel Major told clients in a Friday note. ‚Äî Spencer KimballStocks open Friday‚Äôs session lowerStocks gave up their gains from earlier this week by starting off Friday‚Äôs session in the negative.The S&P 500 lost 0.4%, while the Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.3%.

She also sees an opportunity for margin expansion as a result of improving industrial end demand.‚ÄúWe remain broadly positive on the connector market which is expected to show continued momentum in 2025 following mid-single-digit growth in 2024 (positive book-to-bill ratio), underpinned by strength in IT Datacom (improving broader infrastructure demand, growing AI demand amidst rising cloud capex expectations), improved industrial end market demand outlook (present inclination toward factory automation spending, positive ramp in energy & defense spending), and early signs of a stabilized automotive market (driven by growth in Asia offsetting declines in Europe and NA),‚Äù the analyst also wrote.The upgrade comes as TE Connectivity has already seen meaningful growth this year, with shares rising more than 22% year to date and almost 37% in the past three months. That‚Äôs compared to the S&P 500‚Äôs gains of nearly 7% in 2025 and more than 17% over the last three months.‚Äî Sean ConlonAMC shares pop 7% after Wedbush upgradeErik Mcgregor | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesMarquee at the entrance to AMC movie theater in Midtown Manhattan.AMC saw shares popping 7% in premarket trading Friday after Wedbush upgraded the movie theater chain‚Äôs stock to outperform from neutral.The Wall Street firm said AMC is poised to benefit from a more consistent release slate over the next several quarters.

Why don't you tell me?"" Trump told a reporter who asked who ordered the pause.Trump also repeated he was ""very unhappy"" with Putin and said he was looking into sanctions on Russia as a consequence.And on Wednesday the president was questioned by a reporter as follows:""Yesterday, you said that you were not sure who ordered the munitions halted to Ukraine. Have you since been able to figure that out?"" a reporter asked the president.""Well, I haven't thought about it, because we're looking at Ukraine right now and munitions, but I have, no I have not gone into it,"" he said.The reporter followed up by asking, ""What does it say that such a big decision could be made inside your government without you knowing?""""I would know if a decision was made, I will know,"" Trump stressed. ""I'll be the first to know. In fact, most likely I'd give the order, but I haven't done that yet.""Such obfuscation could be the result of rising anger among Trump's base concerning the policy U-turn. Trump voters have wondered how keeping up the flow of massive monetary and defense aid to Ukraine is 'America first'.Trump on Ukraine: ""We're going to send some more weapons. We have to."" There's been no comprehensive ""halt"" or ""freeze"" of US arms supplies, as had been erroneously reported over the past week. Trump has never opposed arming Ukraine! After all, he's the one who started doing it! pic.twitter.com/4f88FX8zvk‚Äî Michael Tracey (@mtracey) July 8, 2025This is especially as Trump had earlier swiped at Zelensky over the aid, calling him the ""world's greatest salesman"". But more recently Trump has expressed frustration at lack of peace negotiations between Moscow and Kiev getting off the ground. Tyler DurdenFri, 07/11/2025 - 04:15",2025-07-11 08:15:00+00:00

banknews,pi,78-year-old who has written over 175 books: My 4 ‚Äòhard rules' for keeping my brain sharp and quick,"In July 2023, about 40 people gathered to watch the season 5 premiere of ‚ÄúLove Island USA‚Äù at a rooftop bar in central LA.The event was the brainchild of Maddy Biebel, a digital marketer working to revamp the restaurant‚Äôs weeknight programming. She wanted to test out her new concept, Reality Bar: Think, a sports bar, but for reality TV watch parties.Fast forward to this summer, and on a recent evening, Reality Bar hosted another watch party for the current season of ‚ÄúLove Island‚Äù to a packed house of some 200 people at Hollywood‚Äôs The Palm & The Pine. Across LA, hundreds more viewers gathered at bars around the city, steered by Reality Bar‚Äôs Instagram page, eager to catch up on their favorite islanders in Fiji with other fans.LA business owners who‚Äôve joined forces with Biebel and Reality Bar say they‚Äôve been ‚Äúblown away‚Äù by the results in recent weeks: increased sales and more potential regulars after ‚ÄúLove Island‚Äôs‚Äù season finale airs Sunday on Peacock. For Biebel, Reality Bar‚Äôs recent success has been a whirlwind, but not a surprise.‚ÄúI‚Äôve always been very confident that this is something that people want, and something that people would like to do, and I just don‚Äôt know why people aren‚Äôt doing it yet,‚Äù she tells CNBC Make It.‚ÄòThe original Los Angeles ‚ÄúLove Island‚Äù watch party‚ÄôIt‚Äôs taken a few years for other businesses to see the potential in channeling strong online communities around reality TV into in-person opportunities. ‚ÄúThe amount of nos that I‚Äôve gotten from Reality Bar has absolutely outweighed the yeses,‚Äù Biebel says.But June was a record month for Reality Bar: It hosted 21 events across five venues, the majority of which were for ‚ÄúLove Island.‚Äù Nine bars are partnering with Biebel to stream the ‚ÄúLove Island‚Äù finale on Sunday. And one recent event included a surprise appearance from two contestants who were recently dumped from the island.‚ÄúI‚Äôve seen a lot of people call me the original Los Angeles ‚ÄòLove Island‚Äô watch party, which I love,‚Äù Biebel says.Reality Bar has also hosted watch parties for shows like ‚ÄúThe Bachelor,‚Äù ‚ÄúSurvivor,‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Traitors.‚ÄùJack YaegerLA country bar Eastwood hosted its first ‚ÄúLove Island‚Äù watch party in June with the help of Reality Bar and Cider, the clothing brand.These days, Biebel spends upwards of 20 hours per week on Reality Bar (and likely more during recent weeks) doing marketing, graphic design, scheduling events and talking with venue owners. She pours into the side hustle on top of her day job working as a digital marketer for several brands in hospitality, including Ggiata Delicatessen, which is owned by her brother and his two friends.Biebel says she personally funds the majority of Reality Bar‚Äôs operations, and any earnings go back into the project like by hiring photographers or building out the events, which are free to attend.The project feels bigger than a job, Biebel says: ‚ÄúWith Reality Bar, it wasn‚Äôt until I saw community start to form that it really felt like my calling, in a way, to just provide a space for people to gather and to build community.‚ÄùThe pandemic gave rise to more conversations around America‚Äôs loneliness epidemic, and some experts point to gatherings at third spaces (places that aren‚Äôt the home, school or work) as a means of helping people feel more connected.‚ÄúThe main reason I love the concept of a watch party is: You‚Äôre showing up to a room of a bunch of other people who care about the same things that you care about. And that‚Äôs immediately a way you can talk to someone or make a new friend,‚Äù Biebel says.‚ÄúPeople have showed up to the watch parties by themselves, and they leave with seven new friends. That is worth more to me than any amount of money that I could ever make from this concept.‚ÄùAlong the way, Biebel says she‚Äôs been in talks with other people who work in unscripted TV and with networks to grow her project ‚Äúin a way where I‚Äôm not stepping on anyone‚Äôs toes, and I‚Äôm truly just out here doing grassroots marketing for people.‚ÄùShe also tries to partner with other pop-up event organizers around town. At one recent watch party, guests were invited to partake in a speed dating event hosted by Friend or Flame; other watch parties are followed by karaoke or performances from live bands.Looking aheadBiebel eventually hopes to turn Reality Bar into her full-time business.‚ÄúIdeally in the future, [I] would love to have a more formal partnership with the networks and act as a marketing arm and a way for them to build their communities in real life,‚Äù she says.She estimates that thousands of TV-obsessed Angelenos have attended a Reality Bar event by now.Daphne ReyesReality Bar‚Äôs watch parties have gotten so big that two ‚ÄúLove Island‚Äù contestants made a surprise appearance at a recent event.Biebel won‚Äôt have much time to rest after ‚ÄúLove Island‚Äù fever simmers down ‚Äî Reality Bar is already gearing up to host weekly watch parties for the new season of ‚ÄúBig Brother,‚Äù and she hopes to one day tap into Bravo‚Äôs ‚ÄúReal Housewives‚Äù fandom.‚ÄúIf enough people DM me about a show or a finale or reunion, I‚Äôll find a place to do it,‚Äù Biebel says. ‚ÄúAt the end of the day, that‚Äôs what this is. I will find a place for you to gather.‚ÄùDisclosure: Peacock is the streaming service of NBCUniversal, parent company of CNBC.Are you ready to buy a house?

banknews,trump,Tron's Justin Sun says he's buying another $100 million of Trump's memecoin,"Stocks dropped Friday, a day after the S&P 500 posted a new record high, after President Donald Trump announced a 35% tariff on Canada and threatened higher tariffs across the board.The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 297 points, or 0.7%. The S&P 500 slid 0.3%, and the Nasdaq Composite was trading 0.2% lower.Trump cited fentanyl as a reason for higher Canada duties, adding that they would go higher if the country retaliates. ‚ÄúIf Canada works with me to stop the flow of Fentanyl, we will, perhaps, consider an adjustment to this letter,‚Äù Trump said in a letter posted on Truth Social.Trump then told NBC News he was planning blanket tariffs of 15% to 20% on remaining countries, higher than the current 10% standard that investors had grown comfortable with.‚ÄúI think the tariffs have been very well-received. The stock market hit a new high today,‚Äù Trump told NBC News on Thursday.Traders were also waiting on a trade update from Trump on the European Union this week, but it‚Äôs not clear whether the president will post a letter with a new rate like he did with Canada or simply give an update on progress of ongoing deal talks.Friday‚Äôs losses came after all three major averages rose during Thursday‚Äôs session.The S&P gained 0.3% on Thursday to notch a new record, while the tech-focused Nasdaq finished higher by 0.1% as investors shrugged off any worries around the latest trade developments, including a 50% U.S. tariff on imported copper as well as a 50% tariff on Brazil unveiled this week.Friday‚Äôs losses pushed the major averages into the red for the week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was on pace to end the week with a 1.1% decline, while the S&P and Nasdaq were tracking for respective losses of 0.5% and 0.2%.‚ÄúThis has been a week thus far where the rising rhetoric around trade didn‚Äôt adversely affect markets. Investors were able to look through that to a certain extent, but the order of magnitude with one of our most important trade partners that just got dumped in our laps overnight was an eye opener,‚Äù said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth Management.Next week, investors will need to navigate the start of second-quarter earnings reporting season, along with the release of some key inflation data.Markets are becoming increasingly desensitized to tariff shocks, Barclays saysThis week‚Äôs increased tariff news has resulted in relatively ‚Äúless pain‚Äù for the equity market, versus the major selloffs that were observed in April after President Donald Trump first announced his sweeping universal levies.‚ÄúInstead, stocks continued to melt-up, VIX went lower and gold prices declined. So markets have become increasingly de-sensitive to tariff threats, and do not take high tariff rates for granted any more,‚Äù Barclays wrote in a Friday note.But still, this doesn‚Äôt mean that equities are in the clear just yet, the bank warned.‚ÄúHowever, while investors may be cheering the peaking tariffs uncertainty, the impact on growth and inflation down the road is yet to be seen. And more ‚Äòpunishment‚Äô tariffs, as the 50% rate on Brazil, could challenge the prevailing optimistic view, if they aren‚Äôt pure negotiation tactics and followed by de-escalation,‚Äù Barclays continued.‚Äî Lisa Kailai HanWolfe Research sees a ‚Äòscarcity of secular growth‚Äô in the current marketNow may be an especially difficult time for growth investors to find compelling trades, according to Wolfe Research.‚ÄúOur view is that the economy is in a later cycle environment and there‚Äôs a scarcity of secular growth in the market,‚Äù the firm wrote in a Friday note to clients. ‚ÄúAs such, we believe investors will continue to pay up for growth until they believe there is another cyclical upturn in the U.S. economy (perhaps late this year/ 1H ‚Äô26).‚ÄùThe firm added that most companies expected to grow their revenues greater than 10% this year belong to either the technology or communication services sectors.‚Äî Lisa Kailai HanRegional bank rebound might be overdone, Piper Sandler cautionsEarnings reports next week could put the recent strength of regional banks versus their largest peers to the test, according to Piper Sandler.Over the past month, the SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF (KRE) has jumped 8.5%, outperforming JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley. Some of the largest regional banks are performing even better, with Citizens Financial up 15% over the same time period.‚ÄúPreference seems to be shifting from universals to the large regionals given the latter‚Äôs ‚Äòless stretched‚Äôvaluations. Still, despite the solid fundamental backdrop, some are beginning to wonder whether the group has rebounded too far too fast. For our part, we highlight C as the most attractively valued universal, and we call out CFG and KEY as favorites among the regionals,‚Äù Piper Sandler analyst R.

banknews,trump,"BMI Dismisses Trump's Copper Tariff As Likely Just A ""Negotiating Tool, Not Serious Proposal""","BMI Dismisses Trump's Copper Tariff As Likely Just A ""Negotiating Tool, Not Serious Proposal"" The global copper industry had been on edge since the start of President Trump's second term amid rising tariff threats. Earlier this week, those fears materialized when the Trump administration announced a 50% tariff on all copper imports, set to take effect August 1, citing a strong national security assessment. Still, questions remain over how long the tariffs will last‚Äîand whether they'll ultimately be reversed. Analysts from BMI Research, a unit of Fitch Group, view the impending 50% copper import tariffs as merely a negotiation tactic rather than a serious policy, intended to pressure trading partners into fairer agreements.""The tariff threat is, of course, a negotiating tool more likely rather than a serious proposal,"" BMI analysts wrote in a Thursday report to clients.In fact, tariffs are primarily used by the Trump administration as economic tools to pressure trading partners into offering market access, policy reforms, or more favorable trade terms. This view is echoed by the analysts, who believe the president will ultimately walk back the copper tariff, summed up by the acronym TACO: ""Trump Always Chickens Out."" They said the president ""always backs down on his tariff threats."" However, the analysts warned of a painful market adjustment if the tariffs are not reversed. They cautioned that the policy could backfire by undermining the competitiveness of American manufacturing firms without meaningfully reducing the country's reliance on imports. Additionally, they noted it could harm the U.S. refining sector, as a widening spread between domestic and global copper prices would likely prompt foreign exporters to redirect finished copper products toward the U.S. market.So, with Chinese stocks dwindling and U.S. stocks soaring, and by the way, Goldman expects a further acceleration in shipments into the U.S. in the coming weeks, as the incentive to front-run the tariff implementation has increased... ... tariffing copper right now is interesting in its timing‚Äîwhether it's intended as a negotiation tactic with trade partners or, as a strategy to flood the U.S. with copper supplies to bridge the gap until domestic supply chains come online.

The bank first revealed definitive plans to acquire Discover in February of last year. Shares of Capital One have climbed more than 11% since the deal closed, according to FactSet, and the stock is currently up 23.26% year-to-date.While Capital One has always been a major credit card issuer, the merger gives it ownership of one of the top payment networks, Cramer said, which is a big opportunity for the company. The acquisition allows Capital One to scale up and become ‚Äúa truly global payments platform,‚Äù he continued. Cramer said the acquisition also reduces the company‚Äôs reliance on MasterCard and Visa, as it has its own payment network that can collect transaction fees directly.Cramer was pleased that Capital One expects the deal to boost earnings per share 15% by 2027 and realize $1.5 billion in cost synergies. The acquisition also unlocks new international opportunities for Capital One, Cramer continued, and provides the scale to invest more heavily in premium perks for cardholders.According to Cramer, there‚Äôs still a chance to get in on the stock despite its recent gains.

banknews,trump,T-Mobile Scraps DEI Programs To Better Align With Trump Admin Policies,"T-Mobile Scraps DEI Programs To Better Align With Trump Admin Policies Authored by Katabella Roberts via The Epoch Times,T-Mobile officially scrapped its diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs to better align itself with the Trump administration‚Äôs policies, it has confirmed.In a letter to FCC Chair Brendan Carr, T-Mobile executive Mark Nelson said the wireless carrier had made some ‚Äúadjustments‚Äù to ensure its policies and practices ‚Äúmaintain close alignment with our values‚Äù and are ‚Äúresponsive to the direction you‚Äôve provided.‚Äù‚ÄúFor the last several years, we have described some aspects of our company culture and practices as aligned with ‚Äòdiversity, equity, and inclusion‚Äô (DEI),‚Äù Nelson wrote. ‚ÄúOur primary intention always was to create a culture that makes employees feel supported and therefore able to bring their best to the company.‚ÄùNelson said the mobile carrier believes that ‚Äúskills, aptitude, and a growth mindset are what contribute to exceptional performance‚Äîand that merit is how you advance at our company, regardless of who you are or where you‚Äôre from.‚ÄùThe company recognizes, however, that the ‚Äúlegal and policy landscape‚Äù surrounding DEI under federal law has changed, and it remains ‚Äúfully committed to ensuring that T-Mobile does not have any policies or practices that enable invidious discrimination, whether in fulfillment of DEI or any other purpose,‚Äù he wrote.To that end, T-Mobile is ending DEI-related policies ‚Äúnot just in name but in substance,‚Äù according to Nelson.The company will no longer have any individual roles or teams focused on DEI, and is redirecting the ‚Äúhandful‚Äù of employees who had previously focused on DEI within its human resources department to employee culture and engagement.It is also removing any references to DEI on its websites, future communications, and employee training materials, Nelson said.In addition, Nelson said the company will not take part in recognition surveys that ‚Äúfocus on employees‚Äô protected characteristics.‚ÄùNelson also noted that the company informed the FCC earlier this year that it was eliminating specific targets or goals for ‚Äúdiverse spend‚Äù in its procurement policies.He said state regulators have required T-Mobile to set ‚Äúnon-binding goals‚Äù for spending with suppliers that are ‚Äúowned by particular demographic groups, and federal policy has promoted consideration of suppliers‚Äô diversity characteristics.‚ÄùThough the goals weren‚Äôt requirements, the wireless carrier has changed its supplier diversity program to a supplier development program that ‚Äúfocuses on small businesses and not specifically on suppliers whose owners identify with a particular race, sex, sexual orientation, or other protected characteristic,‚Äù he said.‚ÄúI appreciate the chance to explain how our values complement your commitment to promoting excellence and merit, expanding free speech and expression, and ensuring workplaces are free of invidious forms of discrimination,‚Äù Nelson concluded the letter.President Donald Trump has issued multiple executive orders aimed at ending DEI policies and programs since taking office as part of efforts to ensure every person is treated with ‚Äúequal dignity and respect‚Äù and that federal funding is spent properly.Carr welcomed the move from T-Mobile in a statement on social media platform X, calling it ‚Äúanother good step forward for equal opportunity, nondiscrimination and the public interest.‚ÄùFCC Commissioner Anna Gomez, a Democrat, criticized T-Mobile‚Äôs decision, writing on X, ‚ÄúIn yet another cynical bid to win FCC regulatory approval, T-Mobile is making a mockery of its professed commitment to eliminating discrimination, promoting fairness, and amplifying underrepresented voices.‚ÄùT-Mobile is awaiting FCC approval for its $4.4 billion deal to buy almost all of regional carrier U.S. Cellular‚Äôs wireless operations, including its customers, stores, and 30 percent of its spectrum licenses and spectrum leases.In a May 2024 statement, T-Mobile said it expected the transaction to close by the middle of 2025.The FCC is also looking at T-Mobile‚Äôs plan to establish a joint venture with the global investment firm KKR to acquire a 50 percent stake in the internet service provider Metronet.T-Mobile said in a July 2024 statement that it would invest $4.9 billion for the stake, along with 100 percent of Metronet‚Äôs residential fiber retail operations and customers.

He emphasized, ""NATO is paying for those weapons, 100%.""He went on to preview that once the weapons are purchased by NATO allies, ""then NATO is going to be giving those weapons"" to Ukraine. He described that the deal was struck in June at the NATO summit in the Netherlands:""We‚Äôre sending weapons to NATO, and NATO is paying for those weapons, 100%. So what we‚Äôre doing is the weapons that are going out are going to NATO, and then NATO is going to be giving those weapons [to Ukraine], and NATO is paying for those weapons,"" Trump said.Another very interesting part of the interview came when he teased a major Russia-related announcement planned for Monday.Could it be new sanctions, which Ukraine's Zelensky and others have been aggressively lobbying for?Via Reuters/ABC News: Secretary of State Marco Rubio meets with Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on the sidelines of the ASEAN Foreign Ministers' Meeting at the Kuala Lumpur Convention Centre in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, July 10, 2025.""I‚Äôm disappointed in Russia, but we‚Äôll see what happens over the next couple of weeks,"" Trump said. ""I think I‚Äôll have a major statement to make on Russia on Monday,"" he added without elaborating.As for new weapons systems for Ukraine, a fresh Reuters report has said this could total up to $300 million in new arms. Alarmingly, the Pentagon has been running low on its own stockpiles, with Patriot missiles in particular in short supply and high demand, and slow to replace.Secretary of Defense Marco Rubio told reporters while in Malaysia this week of the Patriots, ""Well, the Spaniards have them. They‚Äôre really far from Ukraine and they have one. The Germans have, others have them ‚Äî I‚Äôm not singling them out, but I‚Äôm just telling you those are two that I know.""""There are other Patriot batteries, and there are other opportunities,"" he added.""Countries that have ordered Patriot batteries that are about to receive shipments of them, it‚Äôd be great if one of them volunteered to defer that shipment and send it to Ukraine instead,"" Rubio said.Rubio has been teasing a 'new' approach and potential strategy toward resolving the Russia-Ukraine war, after meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov this week.

banknews,s,It's A Smart Move For Russia To Strike Ukrainian Draft Centers,"It's A Smart Move For Russia To Strike Ukrainian Draft Centers Authored by Andrew Korybko via Substack,The Financial Times (FT) reported that ‚ÄúRussia attacks Ukraine‚Äôs draft offices in effort to undermine armed forces‚Äù, which drew attention to its latest strategy nearly three and a half years into the conflict.What began as a special operation quickly transformed into a proxy war that‚Äôs since become a ‚Äúrace of logistics‚Äù/‚Äúwar of attrition‚Äù.Accordingly, without Trump coercing Zelensky to comply with Putin‚Äôs demands for peace and given his promise to send more ‚Äúdefensive weapons‚Äù, the conflict will continue.It therefore makes sense that Russia would finally target Ukraine‚Äôs military logistics, particularly its draft centers, with a view towards preventing Kiev from replenishing its frontline losses in order to consequently raise the chances of a game-changing breakthrough somewhere along the front. Russia still won‚Äôt destroy Ukraine‚Äôs bridges across the Dnieper, possibly for the reasons speculated here last year, but striking its draft centers is better than nothing and could give also Russia a soft power edge.As the FT acknowledged in their report, these draft centers are incredibly unpopular among the people, so it therefore follows that Russia‚Äôs destruction of them could lead to average Ukrainians breathing a sigh of relief and perhaps becoming more inclined towards a political solution to this long-running conflict. Those that already were anti-Russian or became so throughout the course of the hostilities might not change their political views, but what‚Äôs important is that they might not oppose concessions to Russia.To be sure, the primary reason why Zelensky doesn‚Äôt want to comply with any of Putin‚Äôs demands for peace is because it could set into motion fast-moving events that remove him from power, but public opinion also plays a role in falsely justifying this self-interested position to the population. The independent organization of large-scale protests is practically impossible in Ukraine nowadays due to the SBU‚Äôs domestic dominance, but decisive shifts in public opinion could prompt a power struggle.That institution and/or others could potentially see an opportunity in that scenario to allow some controlled protests for the purpose of pressuring Zelensky ‚Äúfrom below‚Äù into doing what‚Äôs needed to end the conflict, which could then legitimize pressure upon him from their institution(s) too. The goal would be to remove him from power, even if only through the new elections that he promised would shortly follow the end of the conflict, and then potentially profit from lucrative reconstruction contracts.For as compelling as this sequence might seem, it can‚Äôt be taken for granted, but the possibility still remains that Russia might at least obtain a soft power edge if it continues striking these draft centers. More average Ukrainians will likely appreciate that since they don‚Äôt want to die for Zelensky. Even JD Vance recognizes this reality as proven by him telling the world in late February during his fight with Zelensky in the White House about Ukraine‚Äôs forcible conscription policy and recruitment problems.It's therefore a smart move for Russia to finally start striking Ukrainian draft centers since this could raise the chances for a breakthrough somewhere along the front, help to decisively shift domestic public opinion against the conflict, and thus make it easier for ‚Äúdeep state‚Äù forces to conspire against Zelensky. Russia has nothing to lose and everything to gain by keeping up and possibly expanding these strikes since they hit Zelensky where it hurts in more ways than one.* * *Views expressed in this article are opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of ZeroHedge.

To provide Canadians with increased access to affordable and sustainable housing, the governments of Canada and Alberta today announced funding of $203 million to help build over 2,300 affordable housing units across the province. This investment is cost-matched by both governments thanks to the Canada ‚Äì Alberta Bilateral Agreement under the National Housing Strategy. This funding is delivered through Alberta's Affordable Housing Partnership Program (AHPP). The announcement was made by the Honourable Eleanor Olszewski, Minister of Emergency Management and Community Resilience, Minister responsible for Prairies Economic Development Canada, and Member of Parliament for Edmonton Centre, and the Honourable Jason Nixon, Minister of Assisted Living and Social Services.All of the project proposals were assessed based on the local community needs and ability to achieve outcomes for Albertans with low income, as well as value for taxpayer money. Types of projects can include building new housing, mixed-income developments with an affordable and/or social housing component or specialised housing, an addition or renovation of existing housing resulting in a minimum of five net new affordable housing units, conversion of non-rental housing, re-development of an existing site involving demolition and new construction.As we build a strong Canadian housing sector, purposeful collaboration will be essential. That means working hand-in-hand with the non-profit sector to bring down costs and build homes at a scale and speed not seen since the Second World War.Quotes:""We're building a new generation of housing, using every tool available to build homes at a scale not seen since the Second World War.

That's why rational people have been jumping ship from the imploding party. Just look at the tech bros who voted for President Trump and how the right side of the political spectrum reformatted itself with a relatable message: 'America First'...On Thursday, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon spoke at a foreign ministry event in Dublin, blasting the Democratic Party for going off the deep end with DEI, gender politics, and a series of failed policies that he said have harmed the country. ""I have a lot of friends who are Democrats, and they're idiots,"" Dimon said at the event.Holy. Shit.Jamie Dimon on Democrats today:‚ÄúI have a lot of friends who are Democrats today, and they‚Äôre idiots. I always say they have big hearts and little brains.

We all were devoted to reaching out to the Black community, Hispanic, the LGBT community, the disabled ‚Äî we do all of that. But to the extent, they gotta stop it. And they gotta go back to being more practical. They're very ideological.""He described himself as ""barely a Democrat"" since the party of woke has fallen into the abyss. His criticism of the Democratic Party also extended to politics in New York City ‚Äî particularly Manhattan, where the bank is headquartered ‚Äî which now faces the possibility of a Marxist becoming mayor later this year.""Barely a Democrat""? Please. Dimon was a full-blown kneeler not long ago...Jamie Dimon kneeling on a taxpayer. pic.twitter.com/XZi5NS9acO‚Äî Rudy Havenstein, Senior Markets Commentator.

OK, maybe,"" Dimon said. ""There's the same ideological mush that means nothing in the real world.""Dimon's criticism of the Democratic Party is nothing new. In late May, the CEO blasted Democrats for the border invasion they facilitated over the Biden-Harris regime's first term.JAMIE DIMON: ‚ÄúI call it blue tape.

Marxism has become the philosophy of the ‚Äúdeath to America‚Äù class, spanning from the permanent-protest and NGO movements to activist-teachers and into the Democratic Party through the Democratic Socialists of America‚Äîthe political organization Mamdani calls home. Unfortunately, many Democrats remain slow to recognize that this philosophy breeds only misery and is incapable of improving society. In the 1960s, Frances Fox Piven outlined the revolutionary ‚ÄúCloward-Piven strategy‚Äù to deliberately overload social service and welfare systems until they collapse, creating an opening for the far-left to demand a new system and ‚Äúprove‚Äù that capitalism doesn‚Äôt work.

(OTC:SODI) (""Solitron"" or the ""Company"") is pleased to announce fiscal 2026 first quarter results. FISCAL 2026 FIRST QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS ‚ÄìNet sales decreased 32% to approximately $2.70 million in the fiscal 2026 first quarter versus $3.97 million in the fiscal 2025 first quarter.Net bookings increased 37% to $2.80 million in the fiscal 2026 first quarter versus $2.04 million in the prior year first quarter.Backlog increased 94% to $18.26 million at the end of the fiscal 2026 first quarter as compared to $9.41 million at the end of the fiscal 2025 first quarter.Net income (loss) was ($0.34) million, or ($0.16) per share, for the fiscal 2026 first quarter versus net income of $0.59 million, or $.28 per share, for the fiscal 2025 first quarter.Revenue continued to be down in the first quarter, similar to the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2025, due to the lag time between receipt of orders and production/fulfillment of those orders. As previously noted in our last press release, we expected lower revenues in this quarter and anticipate sales to pick up at the end of the fiscal second quarter, before reaching a steadier level in the fiscal third quarter.On a positive note, the Company's backlog remains at record levels. Backlog increased from $18.11 million at the beginning of the fiscal year to $18.26 million at the end of fiscal 2026 first quarter.During the quarter we invested $1.65 million for 6.4% of the units in CBE LLC (""CBE""). CBE purchased a 25% interest in CrossingBridge Advisors (""CrossingBridge""), a subsidiary of ENDI Corp., for $25.9 million. CBE will be entitled to a royalty equal to approximately 14.9% of the revenue of CrossingBridge, which equated to an initial ""cap"" rate based on CrossingBridge's revenue run rate as of December 31, 2024, of approximately 11.7%. Solitron's royalty share will be just under 6.4% of CBE's. CrossingBridge reported that its assets under management were $4.0 billion as of June 30, 2025, versus $3.4 billion as of December 31, 2024.By law, certain U.S. Department of Defense officials and other executive branch agency officials are required to submit reports to Congress describing defense and intelligence-related priorities that were not included in the President's annual budget request. These reports, known as unfunded priorities lists (UPLs), identify certain programs, activities, or mission requirements for which appropriations were not requested, along with the funding amounts that may be necessary to resource them. In the recent unfunded priorities list it has been reported that the U.S. Air Force requested an increase in AMRAAM production from 1,200 annually to 2,400 annually by 2028. AMRAAM is the largest defense program that Solitron supplies to.

banknews,s,MTG Moves To Strike Half-Billion Of Military Aid To 'Nuclear-Armed Israel',"MTG Moves To Strike Half-Billion Of Military Aid To 'Nuclear-Armed Israel' Vying for the title of Most Brazen Bull in the china shop that is America's relationship with the State of Israel, Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene announced she will introduce an amendment to strike a half-billion dollars in additional military aid for the country -- and she notably emphasized its status as a nuclear power. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm entering amendments to strike $500 million more for nuclear-armed Israel. And it‚Äôs important to say nuclear-armed Israel, because they do have nuclear weapons,‚Äù Greene said on Steve Bannon's ""War Room"" podcast, an influential hub of the MAGA movement with an audience of listeners comprising not only everyday Americans but also West Wing officials. Marjorie Taylor Greene announced her cost-cutting amendment on Steve Bannon's ""War Room"" podcastThe additional $500 million would flow to a program that lie ""at the heart of Israel's aerial defense operations,"" reports Responsible Statecraft. Greene says enough is enough. ""We already give them $3.4 billion every single year...they don't need another $500 million in our defense budget. That's for the American people's defense,"" Greene told Bannon. ""That's for the defense of the United States of America and our borders."" It's highly significant that, in her references to Israel, Greene used ""nuclear-armed"" five times, noting that ""it's important to say 'nuclear-armed' because they do have nuclear weapons -- this is not a helpless country."" While Greene's nuclear references ostensibly underscored the country's military strength, she may have had other intentions: Spotlighting the hypocrisy of ""nuclear-armed Israel"" pushing the United States to war over Iran's nuclear program. While the US intelligence community has concluded isn't aiming for a nuclear weapon, Greene did give credence to Israel's claims to the contrary, saying last month's US strikes ""on [Israel's] behalf... destroyed Iran's nuclear problem."" Firing a shot across the bow of all Israel aid, by violating a long-standing US government policy of refusing to confirm that Israel has a nuclear arsenal. Those refusals to acknowledge Israel's nuclear status are part of a decades-long conspiracy to keep billions of dollars in aid flowing to Israel in violation of US law. As Brian McGlinchey explained in a deep-dive on the topic at Stark Realities: While having amassed upwards of 200 nuclear warheads, Israel is not a member of the the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT)...That makes U.S. aid to Israel illegal under the Symington Amendment of 1976, which bars economic and military assistance to countries that acquire nuclear reprocessing technology without submitting to international safeguards and inspections. The law was reinforced by the Glenn Amendment of 1977.The proposed redistribution another $500 million of American wealth to Israel is contained in the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), the annual bill that funds the Department of Defense. ‚ÄúThere are some parts of this NDAA that I cannot support, and that‚Äôs continued foreign aid and foreign funding, and it needs to come out,‚Äù said Greene. Bannon called this year's iteration of the NDAA ""disastrous,"" as it calls for a trillion dollars in total purported ""defense"" spending. Greene is among the foremost boosters of President Trump, but said his attack on Iran felt like ""a bait-and-switch"" after his promises to end US wars in the Middle East (Brynn Anderson / AP via Politico) When it comes to opposing Israel's agenda, Greene is on a roll. When Trump last month ordered the United States military to join Israel's war on Iran, Greene lashed out via social media. Noting that she ""traveled the entire country"" campaigning to elect Trump on the basis of his promise to stop foreign wars, Greene said the attack on Iran ""feels like a complete bait-and-switch to please the neocons, warmongers, military industrial complex contracts, and neocon tv personalities that MAGA hates and who were NEVER TRUMPERS!""Also in June, Greene refused to vote for a resolution condemning antisemitism, noting it was the 21st such resolution Congress had voted on just since she took office in 2021. ‚ÄúPrioritizing one group of Americans and/or one foreign country above our own people is fueling resentment and actually driving more division, including antisemitism,"" Greene explained. REP. MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE (R): I‚Äôm filing amendments to stop sending our defense money overseas.Nuclear-armed Israel doesn‚Äôt need more cash. Taiwan doesn‚Äôt either. Jordan and Africa can fund their own programs.This is America‚Äôs budget. Let‚Äôs spend it defending America. pic.twitter.com/l6LsZvKn64‚Äî Bannon‚Äôs WarRoom (@Bannons_WarRoom) July 9, 2025Greene, whose district lies in Georgia's far northwest corner, told Bannon she's also moving to strike $500 million for Taiwan. ""We give them $300 million every year in the State Department, and they just got $2 billion -- two billion with a 'b' in 2024 from the foreign aid supplemental under the Biden administration."" She's also trying to kill an extra $500 million for Jordan, which already gets $1.6 billion a year. Finally, Greene said her amendment to target two things that she finds ""outrageous"": $15 million for AIDS prevention in Africa and $118 in overseas humanitarian aid and disaster relief. On the latter point, she noted, ""I didn't see foreign countries flooding into America when Lahina burned, when California burned...[or] running to Texas right now.""

banknews,s,Plata's Bond Debut: A Bet On Mexico's Digital Banking Boom,"Mexico's digital banking industry is gaining momentum, and Plata, a fast-emerging fintech player, is making waves with its debut bond issuance. Targeting $120 million (with the potential to scale up to $200 million) marks a turning point for a company transitioning from a credit card issuer to a full-fledged digital bank. For us, it's a chance to tap into the growth of financial inclusion in Latin America's second-largest economy. But with high rewards come risks we must note, as usual. So, here's what we need to know about Plata and its latest move.From Credit Cards to Banking: Evolution of PlataPlata started in 2023 as a credit card issuer, focusing on Mexico's underbanked population. A segment that makes up roughly 60% of the country's 130 million people. By December 2024, Plata secured a banking license from Mexican regulators, a game-changer that allows it to issue loans directly from its balance sheet and, starting in 2026, accept deposits upon meeting specific conditions. The change has undoubtedly expanded the company‚Äôs scope of activity and its revenue potential.The company's flagship product, the Plata Card, offers an average credit limit of $10,000 at interest rates exceeding 30%, targeting small loans averaging $200 per customer. With 1.5 million cardholders by mid-2025, Plata has built a diversified portfolio designed to be manageable for its target market. Backed by $450 million in equity financing, including a hefty 70% stake from Baring Fintech Private Equity Americas Fund, Plata also boasts a management team with roots from Tinkoff Bank. This is a fintech known for its innovative, customer-first approach. For a more convenient analogy, this business model is very similar to that used by the American bank Capital One. It allow customers to manage their finances entirely through digital channels, from opening an account to investing, without visiting branches.

banknews,sui,"California, Los Angeles Join Activist Lawsuit Against Federal Authorities Over ICE Operations","California, Los Angeles Join Activist Lawsuit Against Federal Authorities Over ICE Operations Authored by Kimberley Hayek via The Epoch Times,California Attorney General Rob Bonta, along with the attorneys general from several other states, submitted an amicus brief on July 7 in an effort to prevent the federal government from continuing its immigration enforcement operations in Los Angeles.The case, Perdomo v. Noem, was filed on behalf of individuals who say they were unlawfully stopped or detained by federal agents. The lawsuit alleges that federal agencies such as Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) are deploying unconstitutional and unlawful immigration tactics, and stopping individuals based on race and ethnicity.The lawsuit also alleges that the agencies are stripping detainees of constitutionally mandated due process and that ICE and CBP policies ignore the need for reasonable suspicion. The lawsuit also alleges the actions are in violation of the Fourth Amendment.The lawsuit, which was announced on July 2 at the Bubble Bath Hand Car Wash in Torrance, the site of several removal operations, was filed as a result of one specific incident. According to the ACLU of Southern California, five individuals were stopped or arrested on July 2.They subsequently filed suit alongside the Los Angeles Worker Center Network, United Farm Workers, the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights, and legal services provider Immigrant Defenders Law Center.The lawsuit seeks to put an end to the stops and arrests, as well as to ensure those who are detained receive due process and access to counsel while in federal detention.The lawsuit comes just two days after the Trump administration sued the City of Los Angeles on June 30 over its ‚Äòsanctuary city' policies, alleging in federal court that the ordinance violates the Constitution by thwarting immigration enforcement.‚ÄúThe United States Constitution‚Äôs Supremacy Clause prohibits the city from picking and choosing which federal laws will be enforced and which will not,‚Äù United States Attorney for the Central District of California Bill Essayli said in astatement on the lawsuit.The amicus brief supports the plaintiffs in the case, who are requesting a temporary restraining order to prohibit ICE and CBP from carrying out stops in Los Angeles during immigration actions, unless there is reasonable suspicion that a crime has been committed.The attorneys general in their amicus brief also argue that the stops, as well as federal agents wearing masks and concealing the name of the law enforcement agency for which they work, have undermined public safety.‚ÄúThe lawsuit comes amid the Trump Administration conducting aggressive, militaristic immigration raids in Los Angeles that have terrified immigrant and non-immigrant residents alike, chilled community members‚Äô participation in civic society, and impeded law enforcement and public safety,‚Äù Bonta‚Äôs office said in a statement on July 7.Bonta argues that the ICE operations are not about safety or justice, but rather about enforcement quotas.‚ÄúThe actions of ICE and CBP during the raids in Los Angeles are part of a cruel and familiar pattern of attacks on our immigrant communities by an administration that thrives on fear and division,‚Äù Bonta said.California Gov. Gavin Newsom said in a statement that the Fourth Amendment protects everyone from unreasonable searches and seizures.‚ÄúInstead of targeting dangerous criminals, federal agents are detaining U.S. citizens, ripping families apart, and vanishing people to meet indiscriminate arrest quotas without regard to due process and constitutional rights that protect all of us from cruelty and injustice,‚Äù Newsom said.‚ÄúTheir actions imperil the fabric of our democracy, society, and economy. This isn‚Äôt law and order‚Äîit‚Äôs cruelty and chaos. We stand solidly in support of progress, of the law, and the foundation upon which our founding fathers built this great nation.‚ÄùMeanwhile, U.S. Attorney General Pamela Bondi has said the city‚Äôs actions amount to obstruction of federal law.‚ÄúJurisdictions like Los Angeles that flout federal law by prioritizing illegal aliens over American citizens are undermining law enforcement at every level ‚Äì it ends under President Trump,‚Äù Bondi said in a statement on the suit.Bonta likened the Trump administration‚Äôs deportation of illegal immigrants to the 1954 Operation Wetback, under President Dwight D. Eisenhower, in which an estimated 300,000 people were arrested and deported, including naturalized U.S. citizens.‚ÄúThe dragnet has resulted in U.S. citizens being wrongfully detained and has created a culture of fear and COVID-style ghost towns,‚Äù Bonta‚Äôs office said in a statement.The attorneys general of Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Nevada, Oregon, Vermont, and Washington signed on to the amicus brief, which is focused on events taking place in Los Angeles.Los Angeles, Pasadena, Culver City, Montebello, Monterey Park, Pico Rivera, Santa Monica, and West Hollywood, as well as the County of Los Angeles, have also filed a motion to intervene in the Vasquez Perdomo et al. v. Noem et al. lawsuit.‚ÄúThe Administration is treating Los Angeles as a test case for how far it can go in driving its political agenda forward while pushing the Constitution aside,‚Äù Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said.‚ÄúThe City of Los Angeles, along with the County, cities, organizations and Angelenos across L.A., is taking the Administration to court to stop its clear violation of the United States Constitution and federal law. We will not be intimidated ‚Äì we are making Los Angeles the example of how people who believe in American values will stand together and stand united.‚ÄùIn one high-profile arrest, on July 2, ICE arrested Mexican boxer Julio Cesar Chavez Jr. at his home in Studio City, near Los Angeles. Chavez, who the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) says entered the country illegally, is accused of being an associate of the Sinaloa Cartel, which has been designated a foreign terrorist organization.‚ÄúThis Sinaloa Cartel affiliate with an active arrest warrant for trafficking guns, ammunition, and explosives was arrested by ICE. It is shocking the previous administration flagged this criminal illegal alien as a public safety threat, but chose to not prioritize his removal and let him leave and COME BACK into our country,‚Äù DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement on July 3.The DHS said that its Los Angeles operations have resulted in the arrest of those with convictions for murder, pedophilia, fentanyl trafficking, spousal abuse, sexual assault, and armed robbery.‚ÄúUnder the Trump Administration 70% of illegal aliens arrested have been convicted or charged with a crime beyond illegally entering our country,‚Äù McLaughlin said in a statement on June 26.‚ÄúAs bad faith politicians attempt to demean and vilify our brave law enforcement, we will only double down and ramp up our enforcement actions against the worst of the worst criminals.‚Äù Tyler DurdenFri, 07/11/2025 - 15:45",2025-07-11 19:45:00+00:00

banknews,etc,ETC Announces Fiscal 2026 First Quarter Results,"SOUTHAMPTON, Pa., July 11, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Environmental Tectonics Corporation (OTC:ETCC) (""ETC"" or the ""Company"") today reported its financial results for the thirteen week period ended May 30, 2025 (the ""2026 first fiscal quarter"").Robert L. Laurent, Jr., ETC's Chief Executive Officer and President stated, ""We are pleased with the 39% increase in ETC operating income vs. prior year driven by an increase in sales of Aircrew Training Systems (""ATS"") and a decrease in operating expenses as compared to the prior year, as well as our 34% gross profit margin excluding the impact of lower margin sales related to construction of an aeromedical center during the 2026 first fiscal quarter. We exit the quarter with a sales backlog of $73 million and a large pipeline of opportunities.""Fiscal 2026 First Quarter Results of OperationsNet Income Net income was $1.3 million, or $0.07 diluted earnings per share, in the 2026 first fiscal quarter, compared to net income of $1.4 million during the 2025 first fiscal quarter, or $0.08 diluted earnings per share. The $0.1 million decrease is primarily attributable to a $0.4 million, or 385.3% increase in interest expense, net and a $0.4 million, or 1850.0% increase in income tax provision in the 2026 first fiscal quarter as compared to 2025 first fiscal quarter partially offset by the net effect of a $0.9 million increase in ATS net sales, excluding the Aeromedical center building revenue, and a $0.7 million decrease in Commercial/Industrial Systems (""CIS"") net sales, and a $0.5 million decrease in operating expenses.Net SalesNet sales in the 2026 first fiscal quarter were $17.6 million, an increase of $4.1 million, or 30.5%, compared to 2025 first fiscal quarter net sales of $13.5 million. The increase in net sales was mainly a result of a $4.8 million, or 74.9% increase in ATS sales, $3.9 million of which relates to aeromedical center building revenue, slightly offset by a $0.8 million, or 14.2% decrease in Sterilizer Systems sales in the 2026 first fiscal quarter as compared to 2025 first fiscal quarter.Gross ProfitGross profit for the 2026 first fiscal quarter was $4.7 million (26.5% of net sales) compared to $4.5 million in 2025 first fiscal quarter (33.6% of net sales). The decrease in gross profit margin as a percentage of sales was a direct result of the increase in aeromedical center building revenue within the ATS business unit, which is lower margin than ETC's core businesses as the work is being performed by a sub-contracted construction firm. Excluding the impact of the aeromedical center building revenue, gross profit margin was 34.3% for first fiscal quarter 2026 as compared to 33.9% for first fiscal quarter 2025.Operating ExpensesOperating expenses, including sales and marketing, general and administrative, and research and development, for the 2026 first fiscal quarter were $2.5 million, a decrease of $0.5 million, or 16.0%, compared to $3.0 million for the 2025 first fiscal quarter. The decrease in operating expenses was due primarily to lower research and development expense at ETC-PZL in 2026 first fiscal quarter as compared to 2025 first fiscal quarter. In 2025 first fiscal quarter, ETC-PZL had limited sales which resulted in employees working on non-chargeable research and development projects.Operating IncomeOperating income for the 2026 fiscal first quarter was $2.2 million, an increase of $0.6 million, or 39.4%, compared to $1.6 million for the 2025 first fiscal quarter. The increase in operating income is attributable to the net effect of a $0.9 million increase in ATS net sales, excluding the Aeromedical center building revenue, and a $0.7 million decrease in Commercial/Industrial Systems (""CIS"") net sales, and a $0.5 million decrease in operating expenses.Interest Expense, NetInterest expense, net, for the 2026 first fiscal quarter was $0.6 million compared to $0.1 million in the 2025 first fiscal quarter, an increase of $0.4 million, or 385.3%, reflecting increased borrowing attributable to the leaseback of the demonstration equipment in 2025 fourth fiscal quarter.Income Tax ProvisionIncome tax provision for the 2026 first fiscal quarter was $0.4 million compared to $0.0 million in the 2025 first fiscal quarter, an increase of $0.4 million, or 1850.0%. The increase is a non-cash tax expense attributable to the utilization of our Net Operating Loss (NOL) carryforward for which a deferred tax asset was established in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025.Cash Flows from Operating, Investing, and Financing ActivitiesDuring the 2026 first fiscal quarter, cash flows used in operating activities were $2.7 million, a decrease of $5.6 million compared to cash flows provided by operating activities of $2.9 million during 2025 first fiscal quarter. Cash flows during the 2026 first fiscal quarter primarily decreased as a result of an increase in accounts receivable, net, slightly offset by an increase in accounts payable, trade for 2026 first fiscal quarter as compared to 2025 first fiscal quarter.Cash used for investing activities primarily relates to funds used for capital expenditures of equipment and software development. The Company's investing activities used $0.1 million during the 2026 and 2025 first fiscal quarter.The Company's financing activities provided $1.0 million of cash during the 2026 first fiscal quarter from borrowings under the Company's credit facility as compared to repayments under the Company's credit facility of $3.1 during the 2025 first fiscal quarter.About ETCETC was incorporated in 1969 in Pennsylvania.

Kennedy Jr. is rescinding a 1998 interpretation of a law that allowed illegal immigrants to access certain government-funded programs, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) said on July 10.Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. testifies on Capitol Hill on May 14, 2025. Madalina Vasiliu/The Epoch TimesThe health secretary is rescinding the interpretation of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA), a law that said illegal immigrants cannot obtain ‚Äúfederal public benefits.‚ÄùThe 1998 interpretation by the HHS said the law‚Äôs definition of benefits ‚Äúdoes not provide sufficient guidance for benefit providers‚Äù and that HHS was stepping in ‚Äúto facilitate compliance‚Äù with a requirement in the law for providers to verify a person‚Äôs qualifications for benefits.It said that certain programs, including Head Start, which provides child care for lower-income families, were accessible to illegal immigrants.That interpretation improperly narrowed the scope of the law, letting illegal immigrants access programs that lawmakers intended only for Americans and qualified immigrants, such as immigrants granted asylum, HHS said on Thursday.‚ÄúFor too long, the government has diverted hardworking Americans‚Äô tax dollars to incentivize illegal immigration,‚Äù Kennedy said. ‚ÄúToday‚Äôs action changes that‚Äîit restores integrity to federal social programs, enforces the rule of law, and protects vital resources for the American people.‚ÄùThe updated policy applies the definition of federal public benefit in the law.The statute defines the benefits as ‚Äò‚Äúany grant, contract, loan, professional license, or commercial license‚Äù provided to an individual, as well as ‚Äúany retirement, welfare, health, disability, public or assisted housing, postsecondary education, food assistance, unemployment benefit, or any other similar benefit for which payments or assistance are provided to an individual, household, or family eligibility unit.‚ÄùHead Start is among the programs included in the updated and expanded list of classified ‚ÄúFederal public benefits‚Äù under the PRWORA, HHS said on Wednesday.In addition to Head Start, HHS is including about a dozen other programs that were previously excluded. Among them are the Community Services Block Grant, the Projects for Assistance in Transition from Homelessness Grant Program, and the Title X Family Planning Program.HHS cited its change as stemming from a February executive order from President Donald Trump, which directed officials to identify government-funded programs that ‚Äúcurrently permit illegal aliens to obtain any cash or non-cash public benefit‚Äù and to then align those programs with the PRWORA.‚ÄúTitle IV of the PRWORA states that it is national policy that ‚Äòaliens within the Nation‚Äôs borders not depend on public resources to meet their needs,‚Äô and that ‚Äòit is a compelling government interest to remove the incentive for illegal immigration provided by the availability of public benefits.‚Äô But in the decades since the passage of the PRWORA, numerous administrations have acted to undermine the principles and limitations directed by the Congress through that law,‚Äù Trump wrote at the time.A notice on the HHS update said people have 30 days after it is formally published to submit comments. The notice has not yet been formally published.HHS said in the notice that it would apply the updated interpretation immediately because ‚Äúany delay would be contrary to the public interest and fail to address the ongoing emergency at the Southern Border of the United States.‚ÄùThe Department of Education on Thursday said it was rescinding the 1998 interpretation of the PRWORA that allowed illegal immigrants to access federal education benefits, while the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, part of HHS, previously said it would increase oversight to make sure states did not pay for health care for illegal immigrants, citing Trump‚Äôs order and the PRWORA.

banknews,s,Even 190% Tariffs Can't Break Our Addiction To China's Cheap Labor,"Even 190% Tariffs Can't Break Our Addiction To China's Cheap Labor Despite falling headline numbers‚ÄîChina‚Äôs share of U.S. imports dropped to 13% in 2024 from nearly 22% in 2017‚ÄîAmerica‚Äôs reliance on Chinese goods remains deeper than it seems, according to Bloomberg. A new paper by researchers from the World Bank and IMF estimates the real figure is closer to 16% when accounting for transshipments through third countries and de minimis shipments under $800 that bypass duties.One major reason: China‚Äôs unmatched manufacturing capability. Businesses, even those hit hard by tariffs, are staying put. Pashion Footwear CEO Haley Pavone, facing an $80,000 tariff in April, still sticks with her Chinese supplier. She considered alternatives but found the upfront costs too high and skilled labor lacking elsewhere.‚ÄúNo one is as optimized as China,‚Äù said Pavone, whose shoes require engineering precision.Bloomberg writes that Trump-era tariffs, aimed at reducing reliance on China, may have limited impact‚Äîor even backfire. Some Southeast Asian nations now face steeper reciprocal tariffs, making them less attractive alternatives for manufacturers.Meanwhile, new research from the Kiel Institute warns that trade talks shouldn‚Äôt overlook services. In 2023, the U.S. ran a ‚Ç¨148 billion ($173B) services trade surplus with the EU‚Äînearly three-quarters the size of its goods trade deficit.Still, U.S. and EU data diverge sharply: ‚ÄúThe EU can go for a carrot-and-stick approach with respect to services trade,‚Äù researchers suggest, promoting digital access while tightening data rules or introducing a digital services tax.Last month, President Trump said Chinese leader Xi Jinping was ""extremely hard"" to make a deal with just days after the president accused Beijing of violating an agreement to roll back tariffs and trade restrictions.This came after Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that U.S.-China trade talks were ""a bit stalled."" As of July 2025, the U.S. and China are in a temporary tariff truce, with reduced rates (30% U.S., 10% China) set to expire August 12. Talks are ongoing, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio meeting Chinese officials this week, though tensions remain high. Broader U.S. tariff threats on other countries have been delayed to August 1 to allow more negotiation time. Tyler DurdenFri, 07/11/2025 - 18:30",2025-07-11 22:30:00+00:00

banknews,s,Goldman Sees Housing Affordability Relief Ahead - Here's The Timeline,"Goldman Sees Housing Affordability Relief Ahead - Here's The Timeline Housing affordability is at its worst in decades, but a new Goldman report suggests some of the most severe pressures may begin to ease, offering modest relief in the years ahead. That's welcome news for prospective homebuyers who've been priced out by soaring home values and the Federal Reserve's aggressive interest rate hiking cycle. ""We are lowering our forecasts for U.S. home price appreciation over the next two years,"" analyst Vinay Viswanathan wrote in a note to clients. He cut the firm's national home price appreciation (HPA) forecast from 3.2% to .5% in 2025, and from 1.9% to 1.2% in 2026. Viswanathan outlined three specific drivers that underpinned his decision to revise the HPA forecast down:First and foremost, recent home price index data has deteriorated, likely reflecting a drop in demand. Case-Shiller, FHFA, and Zillow indices all gauged negative sequential HPA in March, April, and, based on Zillow's higher frequency estimates, May (Exhibit 2). Though some of the weakness can likely be attributed to the acute tariff concerns earlier in the year (which equity prices and, to a lesser extent, consumer sentiment suggest are subsiding), the decline in May consumer spending is evidence that an uncertain growth environment is influencing household financial behavior.Second, the lack of supply that previously bolstered strong HPA is gradually recovering. While most metrics suggest that aggregate supply is still far from overwhelming demand, for-sale inventory of existing homes is approaching pre-COVID levels while for-sale inventory of newly constructed homes is at levels last seen in 2009.Third, we see only limited scope for mortgage rates to decline in a softer growth environment, and our base case is for mortgage rates to decline by only 20-25 bp through the end of 2026. We do not see the pullback in immigration as a major risk for single-family HPA given the likely low headship rate for the humanitarian/undocumented immigrants most affected, but there could be a larger impact on multifamily rents.The analyst emphasized that this does not signal a significant downturn in prices, writing: ""...but meaningful national home price declines remain unlikely.""What caught our attention in the 33-page report was the section outlining modest affordability relief for prospective homebuyers. This is especially important for the folks who've been sidelined in recent years because of higher prices and elevated rates. ""Mortgage rates will likely grind lower,"" Viswanathan wrote in the report, with the 30-year conforming mortgage rate forecasted to end the year at 6.5%. Viswanathan continued, ""Alongside a downtick in mortgage rates, the growing gap between income growth and HPA should help slightly improve housing affordability, albeit remaining historically poor..."" How many young people are still on the sidelines? A lot....According to Census Bureau data, about a third of all 18- to 34-year-olds are still living in their parents' basements or attics.And this.Real estate agents and mortgage originators are praying for a new Fed chief who'll slash rates and bring life back into an industry crushed by Fed Chair Powell.More here from Goldman's Research team available to pro subs.

This combination leverages Resulticks' real-time audience engagement, agentic AI framework, and global reach to drive sustainability, compliance, customer relationships, and collective growth.Executed a memorandum of understanding on May 23, 2025, to acquire Matter DK ApS (""Matter""), subject to definitive agreements, for approximately US$13 million in an all-share deal. Management believes the acquisition of Matter will strengthen the Company's sustainability data coverage, ESG analytics offerings, as well as its automated data collection capabilities.Management Commentary""The year ended March 31, 2025 was a transformative period for the Company, marked by the successful completion of our IPO in January 2025, a 57% increase in revenues and strategic agreements signed during the fiscal year to boost future revenues and client acquisition with leading professional firms such as Russell Bedford International and Baker Tilly Singapore. During the year, we also enhanced our product offerings with the introduction of AI-powered compliance solutions, delivering features such as multi-variant drafting, automated risk reduction, future-proofing for evolving regulations, and improved scalability for users of our Sustainability SaaS reporting platform, diginexESG,"" said Mark Blick, Chief Executive Officer of Diginex Limited. ""We achieved overall revenue growth, driven in part, by a significant licensing agreement and ongoing demand for our core ESG reporting and supply chain risk management products. At the same time, we deliberately shifted resources to accelerate the development of diginexESG and diginexLUMEN, which positions us well for long-term growth and recurring revenues at the expense of revenues from one-off mandates via customization projects.""""We also maintained a disciplined approach to cost management. While general and administrative expenses increased year on year, this was primarily due to IPO related professional fees and the fair value adjustment related to the issuance of preferred shares under an anti-dilution clause following an $8 million capital raise in May 2024. We did, however, achieve cost reductions in employee benefits, IT development and maintenance costs, while continuing to deliver on our product road map, and other discretionary spending. These actions demonstrate our commitment to building a sustainable business model and cost structure that supports future profitability while continuing to fund strategic priorities.""""We're also excited to have signed a memorandum of understanding on March 17, 2025, to pursue a dual listing of our ordinary shares on the Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange,"" said Mr. Blick. ""This planned listing is intended to increase exposure of Diginex to regional and international investors, strengthen our relationships in the Gulf Cooperation Council (""GCC"") region, and support Abu Dhabi's strategic focus on sustainable finance. We believe this step aligns with our long-term commitment to expand our global presence."" The memorandum of understanding also contemplates a planned capital raise of up to USD$250 million focused on large institutional investors based in the GCC and a strategic alliance to support business growth in Abu Dhabi and the surrounding GCC region.""""Importantly, we are advancing our strategy to strengthen and diversify our technology and data capabilities through targeted acquisitions,"" continued Mr. Blick. ""Following the close of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2025, we signed two memoranda of understanding to acquire Resulticks and Matter, subject to definitive agreements. These transactions, if completed, would meaningfully expand our AI-driven data management and sustainability analytics capabilities globally, supporting our vision of delivering integrated, high-value solutions to clients worldwide. While both agreements remain subject to due diligence, negotiation and finalizing definitive terms, they demonstrate our commitment to disciplined, strategic growth through carefully selected acquisitions. We see powerful synergies with Resulticks in targeted sustainability marketing at scale, bringing in Matter's sustainability data for company benchmarking and supply chain due diligence through diginexLUMEN, and the provision of AI enabled sustainability reporting capabilities with diginexESG.""""Looking ahead, we have reason for optimism as our Company is on the leading edge of fundamental changes in the data industry that will drive future growth. We remain committed to investing across the Diginex platforms, enhancing our global market presence both organically and through acquisitions, and managing our operations with discipline to deliver long-term value to our shareholders,"" Mr. Blick stated.Revenues For the year endedMarch 31,in USD millions20252024 Subscription and license fees1.30.4Advisory fees0.30.2Customization fees0.40.7Total 2.0 1.3 For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2025, total revenue increased by $0.7 million to $2.0 million, compared to $1.3 million in the prior year. The increase was primarily attributable to a $0.9 million license fee from the granting of a non-exclusive right to distribute a white-label version of diginexESG. Excluding this transaction, revenue from software subscriptions and licenses remained stable at $0.4 million for the year. Subscription and license fees are generated from sales of diginexESG and diginexLUMEN.Revenue from advisory fees increased modestly to $0.3 million, reflecting an improvement of $0.1 million compared to the prior year. Advisory services includes projects such as developing ESG strategies, conducting ESG materiality assessments or conducting training sessions on a range of ESG topics.The increase in total revenue was partially offset by a decline in revenue from customization projects, which decreased by $0.3 million to $0.4 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2025. This reduction was an expected outcome of the Company's strategic decision to allocate more resources to the development and expansion of diginexESG and diginexLUMEN, leading to a temporary reduction in the acceptance of customization projects.""We are focused on building long-term, sustainable growth across all of our service lines,"" said Mr. Blick.

This increase was primarily driven by higher professional fees associated with the Company's IPO and a share-based payment expense related to preferred shares issued under an anti-dilution clause triggered by a capital raise completed in May 2024. These higher costs were partially offset by reductions in employee benefits, IT development and maintenance support, while continuing to deliver on our product roadmap, and audit fees.Employee benefits decreased by $0.2 million which was the result of reduced costs associated with the fair value of employee share options granted to employees of $0.5 million and a partially offsetting increase in salaries of $0.3 million. Headcount at March 31, 2025 was 32 and included 23 employees and 9 contractors compared to a headcount of 29 at March 31, 2024, which included 22 employees and 7 contractors.Balance Sheet HighlightsAt March 31, 2025, net assets of $4.6 million represented a transformation and significant improvement from net liabilities of $23.0 million at March 31, 2024. The improvement was driven by the capitalization of shareholder loans and advances, convertible loan notes and redeemable preferred shares. The capitalization events were triggered by the IPO.

AFP via Getty ImagesAccording to figures released on July 9 by China‚Äôs National Bureau of Statistics, the producer price index for industrial products in June fell by 3.6 percent compared with the same month in 2024‚Äîworse than a 3.3 percent drop in May, and the biggest annual decline since July 2023.The month‚Äôs purchasing price index for industrial products fell by 4.3 percent year over year, bigger than the 3.6 percent drop in May, and the sharpest decline since August 2023.According to Dong Lijuan, statistician at the National Bureau of Statistics, the producer price index deflation in June was driven by cheaper energy prices, uncertainties in international trade, and hot and wet weather that drove down the price of building materials.Sectors that rely on exports faced more downward pressure in prices, she said.‚ÄúThe prices of computers, communication equipment, and other electronic equipment in June dropped by 0.4 percent [compared to May], the prices of electrical machinery and equipment fell by 0.2 percent, and textile prices fell by 0.2 percent,‚Äù she said.In annual terms, the prices of computers, communication equipment, and other electronic equipment fell by 2.3 percent.China‚Äôs factory activity shrank for a third month in a row in June, albeit at a slower pace, with employment and new export orders still languishing.‚ÄúWe expect demand to weaken later this year, as exports slow and the boost from fiscal support diminishes,‚Äù Zichun Huang, China economist at Capital Economics, said.Market reaction to the data was cautious amid uncertainties in the trade war between the United States and other economies. China‚Äôs Shanghai Composite Index was up by 0.3 percent by the midday break, while Hong Kong‚Äôs benchmark Hang Seng Index traded down by 0.7 percent.As subdued domestic demand remains a drag on China‚Äôs economy, companies have resorted to price discounts to boost sales, prompting the authorities to urge an end to the auto industry‚Äôs bruising price wars.Highlighting the tepid consumer market, Chinese e-commerce giants Alibaba and JD.com have pledged heavy subsidies over recent months to expand aggressively into fast deliveries.Consumer prices rose by 0.1 percent compared with the same month in 2024, following four months of deflation.‚ÄúConsumer inflation is likely to remain near zero for the rest of the year, as structural adjustment continues slowly, with consumer demand weighed by the protracted property downturn and worries over the jobs market,‚Äù Duncan Wrigley, chief China economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said.He also said that trade tensions between Washington and Beijing are likely to continue despite the recent framework agreement.‚ÄúMore flare-ups are likely and cooling export growth will add to downward price pressure in manufactured goods sectors,‚Äù he said.According to supply chain technology provider Descartes, U.S. container imports from China were about 639,300 20-foot equivalent units in June, slightly up (0.4 percent) from May, but a 28.3 percent decline from June 2024.The company said it expects that ‚ÄúChina‚Äôs share of U.S. imports may remain under pressure through the second half of 2025,‚Äù with the upcoming expirations of U.S. tariff pauses extended to Aug. 1 and the trade truce with China on Aug. 12, and with additional U.S. tariffs on transshipped goods via Vietnam.Reuters contributed to this report.

banknews,s,Conservative Creators: Don‚Äôt Let The Liberal Entertainment Crisis Go To Waste,"Conservative Creators: Don‚Äôt Let The Liberal Entertainment Crisis Go To Waste Authored by Brandon Smith via Alt-Market.usWe‚Äôve all heard the argument before ‚Äì ‚ÄúLiberals are the ‚Äòcreatives‚Äô in western culture and conservatives have no imagination‚Äù. And, if you only use venues like the Hollywood film industry or maybe the New York art and literature scenes as examples, then this claim might appear to have validity. After all, the vast majority of filmmakers, writers, actors and artists today are rabidly progressive. It‚Äôs hard to find a single conservative among them.Of course, the argument falls apart when we look back to the artists and musical geniuses of the Renaissance, or the great writers and poets of the early industrial age. In fact, for centuries the creative world was dominated by conservative and Christian powerhouses. It wasn‚Äôt until the quiet leftist invasion of media starting in the 1940s (which was stalled by McCarthy) and the eventual takeover in the 1970s that ‚Äúart‚Äù became the exclusive domain of progressives.How did this happen? How did conservatives get pushed out of the creative world?Well, they‚Äôre still around; thousands upon thousands of them. However, the art world and the realm of entertainment are largely dictated by corporate dollars. Wealthy benefactors used to PAY conservative artists and commissioned great works. Now, they don‚Äôt. Whoever gets the money gets the exposure, and liberal artists get the money. It‚Äôs not about merit, it‚Äôs about ideology and politics.Try to be a new talent with openly conservative views in mainstream film, television, fiction writing, comic books, painting, music, etc. Watch how quickly you are added to the blacklist and how quickly you disappear regardless of how brilliant your work is. It‚Äôs not a conspiracy theory, it‚Äôs observable fact.There are numerous case studies of conservatives in Hollywood being buried by the industry. In literature the progressives learned how to control the bottleneck ‚Äì Nearly all literary agencies are run by leftists (and women), and if you can‚Äôt get representation for your book then it won‚Äôt get nationally published.A common argument among leftists (or idiots) is that women simply read far more and so books that cater to female consumers get the green light. It‚Äôs the ‚Äúfree market‚Äù ‚Äì Don‚Äôt you support the free market?In reality, the woke takeover of literature came first. And, now that books are rarely written by men for men, male readers have no market to tap into. The problem has become so epidemic that a literary company in Britain called Conduit Books announced that they are going to focus on male writers for the foreseeable future. And guess what happened? Mobs of leftists and the corporate media attacked them, arguing that men had their time and now is the time for women to ‚Äúhave a voice‚Äù.In other words, male writers (let alone male conservative writers) aren‚Äôt even allowed to have ONE company that supports their work.As the Gamergate movement exposed, woke activists hijacked gaming by extorting companies with threats of cancellation. They then organized ‚Äúconsultation‚Äù groups (like Sweet Baby Inc.) that invaded the industry and injected woke narratives into every new product. Conservatives are persona non grata in the AAA game development space.Comic books have been utterly destroyed by the political left. An army of feminists and LGBT activists now control every aspect of the comic industry and American comics no longer sell because of woke politics. Did the market die? No, customers simply moved on to the alternatives. Japanese Manga dominates the comic market today with sales that dwarf American comics. In 2021, total US comic sales hit $2.07 billion, with $1.47 billion of that being manga.These are just a few examples of how leftists act as gatekeepers in creative markets. For decades they have dictated who gets exposure and who doesn‚Äôt. And you know whose fault it is? It‚Äôs ours.For many years I have listened to conservatives dismiss pop culture as ‚Äúkids stuff‚Äù and not important compared to politics. Meanwhile, woke saboteurs were slithering into every corner of the entertainment world and planting their degenerate notions into every movie, every show, every song, every book, everywhere you look their cultism is rampant. You can‚Äôt get away from it and we allowed this to happen because we weren‚Äôt paying attention.Luckily, a counter-movement has formed and the vast effort to stop wokeness in media has been largely effective in organizing boycotts. In the past few years nearly every entertainment platform that produces woke material is dying.In movies, production companies are forced to reduce or completely cut out woke messaging in order to draw an audience. The problem is, the leftists still stand guard at the gates. Conservatives still aren‚Äôt getting access to media markets, which means all we are going to get for years to come is progressive slop, or productions that avoid wokeness but remain mediocre.My fear is that audiences will simply settle for mediocre as a replacement for woke; that people will throw up their hands and give up on quality in art and entertainment as long as they‚Äôre no longer bombarded with DEI. It basically means the the death of creativity in the west.So what‚Äôs the solution?It seems so obvious to me that it‚Äôs painful, but maybe conservative creators are so despondent that they‚Äôve given up. The internet and social media offer immense opportunities for independent content creation, but this is not enough. Audiences and investors need to put cash and support behind the alternative content industry.Just as great Christian artists were once given the ability to conjure historic works of grandeur because of commissions, there needs to be a movement to focus production and distribution back into conservative hands.The crisis in liberal entertainment cannot be allowed to go to waste. Never before has the progressive media juggernaut been as weak as it has been in the last few years. Now is the time to take the culture back. Not necessarily by forcing conservative politics into movies and books, but by creating meaningful and powerful art again; art that removes the stains of wokeness.Films and short form fictional content are incredibly cheap to make and distribute compared to 20 years ago. I have always loved the artform of film but when I started writing in the early 2000s the field was prohibitively expensive and digital cameras were in their infancy. Even making a short film could bankrupt the average twenty-something artist with a tight budget.Today, you can get near Hollywood quality digital cameras, lighting, editing, sound, etc, for well under $10,000. Maybe half that price if you buy used. All you need is a good idea and the will to make it happen. Price is no longer a factor like it once was.I will say, though, that conservative filmmakers need some kind of venue to tap into ‚Äì Maybe a yearly short film contest or a screenplay competition. Someone needs to step up and provide an arena where conservative creators can compete for greater opportunities beyond some cash from YouTube.In literature I suspect the crusade will be much more difficult, unless companies with weight and money step in to launch a conservative renaissance in fiction. Self publishing is definitely an option but reach without marketing is limited. The most successful creators will be those with a preexisting audience. A lot of brilliant writers will fall by the wayside because they don‚Äôt already have an online presence.Indie video games are in the wild west phase and there are some incredible success stories out there. As the technology becomes more accessible I suspect leftists will lose their hold on development. It may take another few years, though.I believe comic books is one area that is BEGGING for revitalization and new blood. As noted, the market is huge. American readers are hungry for good stories, they just aren‚Äôt finding them at Marvel and DC because of the woke takeover. No one wants to buy leftist drivel.American comic creators like Eric July have proved that the industry can be saved. His libertarian/conservative ‚ÄúRippaverse‚Äù project has garnered a lot of attention (and a lot of hate) for offering non-woke comic books and he has shown that there is a steady audience for this kind of content.I‚Äôm adding my own limited contribution to the fight with my action/horror graphic novel ‚ÄòMountain Hollow‚Äô which is now in print. A story about a survivalist who fights a guerrilla war against an interdimensional evil. Here‚Äôs a promo video for my book:Anyone interested in purchasing a copy can BUY ONE HERE.I think most people accept the prevailing theory that the political left, with the help of NGOs and even governments, has steamrolled into the cultural zeitgeist with the goal of saturating our media with as much propaganda as possible. Perhaps they they thought we would be so overwhelmed that we would give up and embrace their ideology as the ‚Äúnew normal‚Äù.However, I would suggest that this was only part of their plan. Their secondary goal was to deconstruct western pop-culture should they fail to control it. In other words, if they can‚Äôt have it, they would rather burn it all down to the ground so that no one else can have it. And I have to admit that they are winning when it comes to destroying what remains of our entertainment. The options today look bleak.Stories and art are not simply about fantasy and escapism ‚Äì They are the catalyst by which a civilization passes on its principles, its ideas, its dreams, its lessons and its morals. Leftists understand this all too well. For some reason conservatives are late to the party. There is still time to save our culture from being cast into the pit of despair.We only require an organized effort that provides support to conservative art; a new Renaissance which resurrects the values of merit, talent, hard work and conscience.Views expressed in this article are opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of ZeroHedge.

This purchase brings Sharplink's total ETH holdings to 253,000, with an average purchase price of $2,647. The company's stock, SBET, has outperformed ETH since the first acquisition, with a 486% increase compared to ETH's 17% gain.

While everyone's circle-jerking over all-time highs, Congress is about to vote on three crypto bills that could quietly restructure the entire financial system:

* **GENIUS Act**¬†‚Äî Regulates stablecoins (USDC, USDT, USD1)
* **CLARITY Act**¬†‚Äî Defines what‚Äôs a commodity vs. a security
* **Anti-CBDC Act**¬†‚Äî Bans the Fed from creating a digital dollar

# The GENIUS Act = Stablecoins Go Full TradFi

It turns ‚Äúinternet dollars‚Äù into fully regulated payment tools.

But here‚Äôs the kicker:  
**These coins are backed by U.S. Treasuries.**

Which means:

* Stablecoin adoption = more demand for U.S. debt
* Private issuers = indirect Treasury dealers
* U.S. gov gets funded, issuers get rich

>

This isn't innovation.  
**It's a debt machine with a crypto wrapper.**

# The CLARITY Act = Which Agency Gets to Regulate Your Bag

* CFTC ‚Üí commodities
* SEC ‚Üí securities

This bill defines the turf war ‚Äî but don‚Äôt get it twisted:

**This isn‚Äôt about clarity for you. It‚Äôs about control for them.**

# The Anti-CBDC Act = Fed Banned from Digital Currency

This one straight-up bans the Fed from launching a CBDC.

No FedCoin.  
No public digital dollar.  
Just¬†*private*¬†stablecoins like USDC, USDT, and USD1.

>

No Fed control = no monetary sovereignty.  
Welcome to privatized money.

# The New System:

* **USD1**¬†= MAGA coin
* **Tether + Circle**¬†= digital dollar issuers
* **Treasuries**¬†= the new backing
* **You**¬†= still the exit liquidity

This isn‚Äôt decentralization.  
**It‚Äôs the Fed getting phased out by politicians with  stable coins.**

Why people so fixate on eth? For the most popular ones like USDT and USDC, they exist on Solana, BSC, Tron, etc. What make eth special? It's slow and expensive to do anything on eth.

reddit,s,I need to understand.,"At what point does BTC become a rich man‚Äôs game and retail gets locked out again?

I‚Äôve been thinking about this a lot lately and I‚Äôm genuinely confused. Wasn‚Äôt Bitcoin originally created to help the average person? 

To be a peer-to-peer electronic cash system that bypasses traditional banking gatekeepers?

But here‚Äôs what I‚Äôm seeing:
	‚Ä¢	Transaction fees that can spike to $20+ during busy periods
	‚Ä¢	Lightning Network requiring technical knowledge most people don‚Äôt have
	‚Ä¢	Mining becoming dominated by massive industrial operations
	‚Ä¢	Institutional adoption driving prices to levels where a whole coin costs more than most people‚Äôs annual salary
	‚Ä¢	Self-custody requiring technical skills that intimidate regular users

I keep hearing that Bitcoin is ‚Äúthe best monetary system known to man‚Äù - and maybe it is from a technical standpoint. But if that‚Äôs true, why does it feel like we‚Äôre heading toward a system where only wealthy institutions and tech-savvy individuals can actually use it effectively?

The man on the street who Bitcoin was supposedly created for now needs:

	‚Ä¢	Expensive hardware wallets
	‚Ä¢	Deep technical knowledge of seed phrases, private keys, etc.
	‚Ä¢	Ability to navigate complex DeFi protocols
	‚Ä¢	Enough capital to make transaction fees worthwhile

Meanwhile, the same financial institutions that Bitcoin was meant to disrupt are now buying it up by the billions and potentially manipulating the market just like they do with everything else.
Am I missing something here? 

Is there actually a realistic path for regular people to use Bitcoin as intended, or are we just recreating the same exclusionary financial system with extra steps?

Would love to hear from people who‚Äôve been in this space longer than me. Are there solutions I‚Äôm not seeing, or is this just the inevitable evolution of any successful monetary system?

TL;DR: Bitcoin feels like it‚Äôs becoming exactly what it was created to replace - a financial system that only works for the elite. Change my mind?",2025-07-13 01:09:07+00:00

reddit,s,The Role of Memecoins in Today‚Äôs Cryptocurrency Ecosystem,"Memecoins‚Äîcryptocurrencies inspired by internet memes and viral culture‚Äîhave evolved from niche novelties to significant players in the cryptocurrency landscape. Tokens like Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), Bonk (BONK), and platforms like *Pump<>fun* exemplify their multifaceted impact. As of July 2025, memecoins continue to drive innovation, adoption, and market dynamics across various dimensions, despite their speculative nature. As you may know based on some of my comments and posts, I believe memecoins are a key driving force and they will continue to propel blockchain/CryptoCurrency innovations to audience that desire a soft landing platform to crypto. I have put together this post to portray key examples and recent developments.

## Driving User Adoption and Onboarding
Memecoins serve as an accessible entry point for new crypto users. Their low price points and viral appeal attract retail investors who might otherwise shy away from complex DeFi or NFT projects. Dogecoin, launched in 2013, gained mainstream traction through endorsements from figures like Elon Musk, peaking at a $90 billion market cap in 2021. Its simplicity‚Äîbuilt on a Bitcoin fork‚Äîmade it a gateway for millions to explore crypto wallets and exchanges. Similarly, Shiba Inu, an Ethereum-based token, onboarded users via its ‚ÄúDoge Killer‚Äù branding, reaching a $40 billion market cap in 2021. By 2025, Bonk on Solana has drawn thousands to its ecosystem, with its playful dog-themed narrative boosting Solana wallet creation by ~15% during its 2023 peak, ~ **source** Solana Foundation data.

Recent events, like Pump-fun‚Äôs $500 million PUMP token sale recently, highlight memecoins‚Äô onboarding power. Pump-fun gamified launchpad, which enabled over 5 million meme token creations on Solana *[according to on-chain stats], attracted both creators and speculators, driving platform revenue to $715 million by mid-2025. This accessibility fosters broader crypto adoption, particularly among younger demographics.

## Boosting Blockchain Activity and Liquidity
Memecoins significantly increase transaction volumes and liquidity on their host blockchains. Dogecoin‚Äôs 2021 surge drove transaction spikes on its network, with daily volumes reaching 1.5 million transactions - [*Bitinfocharts*] . Shiba Inu‚Äôs trading on Ethereum contributed ~10-15% to the chain‚Äôs transaction volume during its 2021 peak, according to Dune Analytics. Bonk‚Äôs 2023 rise on Solana similarly boosted network activity [a period when many including holders like me were very skeptical about Solana future after many network halts and restarts], with daily transactions hitting 5million+ during its hype cycle. These surges elevate gas fees and validator revenue, strengthening blockchain economics.

Pumpdotfun success underscores this trend. Its Solana-based platform, with more than $20 million in monthly revenue as of July 2025, has increased SOL demand and liquidity. The PUMP token sale, selling 125 billion tokens in 12 minutes across major exchanges like Bybit and Kraken, amplified Solana‚Äôs market visibility, contributing to a ~20% market cap increase in Q2 2025, per CoinGecko.

## Fostering Innovation and Ecosystem Growth
- Memecoins spur innovation by encouraging developers to build supporting infrastructure. Shiba Inu‚Äôs ecosystem expanded to include ShibaSwap, a DEX, and NFT integrations, enhancing Ethereum‚Äôs DeFi landscape. Bonk‚Äôs success on Solana led to tools like PumpSwap, a DEX launched by Pump-fun in 2025, which shares 50% of trading revenue with token creators. This creator-friendly model has driven developer interest, with Solana‚Äôs dApp ecosystem growing more than 17% since Pump-d-fun‚Äôs January 2024 launch, - DappRadar.

- Memecoins also inspire novel mechanics. Pumps bonding curve model, where token prices rise as buys increase, and its liquidity-locking feature have set new standards for token launches, reducing rug pull risks. These innovations strengthen blockchain ecosystems, attracting more projects and users. A feature that many standalone blockchains lack even with today's crypto market awareness. 

## Cultural and Social Impact
Memecoins leverage internet culture to create and engaged communities, fostering loyalty and advocacy. Dogecoin‚Äôs ‚Äútipping‚Äù culture on platforms like Reddit built a grassroots following, while SHIB‚Äôs ‚ÄúSHIBArmy‚Äù drove social media hype, with over 1 million X[Twitter] followers by 2025. Bonk‚Äôs community-centric airdrops in 2023 revitalized Solana‚Äôs ecosystem post-FTX collapse, boosting morale and adoption.

## Challenges and Risks
Despite their benefits, memecoins pose risks too and it will be very silly to not acknowledge these risks. Their speculative nature fuels volatility‚ÄîPump*d*fun‚Äôs trading volume dropped 75-80% since January 2025 - *[DeFiLlama]*, reflecting market fickleness. Scams, like BSC‚Äôs Squid Game token rug pull in 2021, highlight vulnerabilities. Overreliance on memecoin hype can also skew blockchain development toward short-term gains, potentially deterring serious projects. Regulatory scrutiny remains a concern, as memecoins‚Äô speculative appeal could invite crackdowns, impacting broader markets.

## My take on memecoins
Memecoins like Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, Bonk, and platforms like Pump-fun, etc are more than fleeting trends‚Äîthey drive adoption, liquidity, innovation, and cultural engagement in the crypto ecosystem. While their volatility and risks warrant caution, their ability to onboard users, boost blockchain activity, and inspire new tools is undeniable. As of July 2025, memecoins remain a dynamic force, shaping cryptocurrency‚Äôs growth and mainstream appeal, with Pump-fun‚Äôs $500 million token sale vocalising their enduring impact. However, sustainable growth requires balancing their speculative allure with robust ecosystem development.",2025-07-13 09:17:23+00:00
reddit,s,"The Partnership That Never Was: LINE denies partnership with PARAMETA and ICON ($ICX), now known as SODAX ($SODA)","Disclaimer: I was the lead comms specialist for ICON Foundation for a few years since starting early 2018. However, I did not realize nor was I aware of any of the things during my tenure there. **[You can read the full article here.](https://medium.com/naxy/exposing-the-icon-parameta-lie-the-truth-behind-the-claimed-partnership-with-line-fba17f4e73a3)**

**TL;DR: I recently saws an article on coindesk about how ICON ($ICX) rebranded to SODAX ($SODA), and I thought this would be a good time to bring some awareness to the project so that people can make better informed decisions and investments.**

**ICON ($ICX) / SODAX ($SODA) and PARAMETA have claimed for years that LINE (Japan's massive messaging app) uses their blockchain technology. I emailed LINE directly to verify. LINE responded clearly stating they have ""absolutely no relationship"" with ICON or PARAMETA.**

It appears ICON used this alleged partnership to legitimize their project, attract investors, raise funds, and establish other ""empty"" partnerships. Additionally, ICON heavily promoted Blue Whale Foundation--a project that abruptly ceased operations after raising over $21 million USD during its ICO--with ICON/PARAMETA executives serving as the team advisors and getting compensated possibly hundreds of thousands of dollars for it. Their recent rebranding to SODAX could be an attempt to distance themselves from these controversies and false promises. 

**Classic blockchain marketing tactic: claim big partnerships that don't materialize into anything, then rebrand when people catch on.**

- No actual collaboration with LINE: In October 2024, LINE‚Äôs blockchain team explicitly denied any relationship with ICON/PARAMETA, stating that assertions about loopchain integration into LINE‚Äôs LINK Chain are false.

- Strong marketing, weak follow-through: ICON and PARAMETA promoted multiple supposed partnerships (Samsung, SK Planet, Smilegate, etc.) and projects (like Blue Whale Foundation), which never materialized and/or raised millions of dollars only to cease operations overnight.

- Big-picture concern: These claims likely inflated perceived legitimacy--potentially misleading investors and the broader community.

- Strategic rebranding? ICON‚Äôs shift to SODAX ($SODA) appears timed to distract from past controversies, raising questions about motives behind the transformation.

- Call for transparency: The article urges ICON/SODAX and PARAMETA to provide verifiable evidence or issue clarifications to address these serious allegations. My calls for transparency and bringing awareness to the /r/helloicon community, a subreddit that I managed during its peak years, resulted in me getting permanently banned for ""FUD"" despite the fact that nothing I stated was false, deceptive, nor misleading. It was honestly a little surprising and sad to see a subreddit community that I helped grow and have it be an open forum for people to share genuine concerns and criticisms become into a dead subreddit where practically every user is banned (excluding the occasional posters that are just mods or paid p-reps).

reddit,eth,"How Restaked ETH is Being Used to Build a 'Supreme Court' for Crypto, Judging Everything from AI to Oracles","For years, blockchains have excelled at enforcing objective truth: cryptographic, provable, indisputable. But as we push into richer domains like verifiable AI, decentralized social media, and advanced oracle networks, we‚Äôre hitting a wall. These new frontiers bring subjective questions that can‚Äôt be resolved by code alone.

This is where a new architectural pattern emerges: layered trust. At its core, it combines the hard guarantees of Ethereum with the flexibility of human judgment.

A leading example is the Verifiable Cloud (EigenCloud on @EigenLayer). Its security model has two distinct layers:

‚Ä¢ Restaked ETH enforces objective rules ‚Äî was the data posted? did the computation execute? ‚Äî with automatic slashing for failure. No interpretation needed.
‚Ä¢ EIGEN handles subjective disputes: was an oracle‚Äôs source reliable? did an AI‚Äôs output meet agreed standards? ‚Äî via decentralized arbitration.

The brilliance lies in the separation of concerns. Ethereum‚Äôs validator set, amplified through restaking, forms an unshakable foundation. On top of this foundation, EIGEN provides a social layer for gray areas where algorithmic certainty ends and human discernment begins.

The ""slash-and-fork"" mechanism is key here. When disputes arise, stakers vote. Malicious actors are slashed; honest participants fork to the correct state. Crucially, this mechanism works because it inherits the economic weight of Ethereum. Without ETH‚Äôs security budget underpinning it, the system wouldn‚Äôt hold.

This is the crux: the subjective layer only has value because it‚Äôs anchored to Ethereum‚Äôs objective guarantees. This layered approach could unlock decentralized governance, AI moderation, and trust-minimized data services ‚Äî all backed by the most battle-tested security in crypto.

It also reframes staking itself. No longer just a passive yield generator, restaked ETH becomes an active force, providing programmable trust to power the emerging verifiable internet.

If it works, we could see an entire class of oracles, AI agents, data-availability layers, and even rollups renting Ethereum‚Äôs security instead of bootstrapping their own. This composability makes ETH not just a currency or a commodity but the base layer for digital truth.

banknews,s,These college majors have the best job prospects ‚Äî and they aren't what students expect,"Majoring in finance is still considered the ticket to a well-paying position after college, and that is mostly true. But when it comes to employment prospects, majors in art history, nutrition and philosophy all outperform some business and STEM-focused alternatives, according to a recent analysis by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.For many students, majoring in finance is a proven pathway to a well-paying career and job security.In fact, U.S. graduates believe that finance offers the best career prospects overall, considering today‚Äôs economic climate, according to a new survey by the CFA Institute, a non-profit focused on financial education. The group polled more than 9,000 current college students and recent graduates between the ages of 18 and 25.While confidence about career prospects in finance increased over the past year, confidence decreased in other areas including STEM and healthcare, the CFA Institute also found.However, finance ranks well behind many other majors when it comes to employment opportunities after college, other data shows.More from Personal Finance:Trump aims to slash Pell GrantsStudent loan borrowers face ‚Äòdefault cliff‚Äô, report findsWhat the endowment tax in Trump‚Äôs megabill may mean for college‚ÄúFor me, a career in finance represents a pivot to stability,‚Äù said Rafael Perez, 29, who is pursuing a Master of Science degree in finance at California State University in Sacramento. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been a creative my entire life, so discovering my affinity for finance was a relief in a sense.‚Äù Perez says he still experiences some pushback from his peers. ‚ÄúWhen I tell people I‚Äôm getting an MS in finance, they often jokingly call me a ‚Äòfinance bro,'‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúDespite the negative connotations of the phrase, it also reflects an expectation of financial success and prestige.‚ÄùStudents and their families are paying more attention to which college majors are most likely to pay off, and are putting greater emphasis on a degree‚Äôs return on investment, according to Peter Watkins, CFA Institute‚Äôs senior director of university programs. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs an awareness from students that they have to make sure the degrees will make them work-ready,‚Äù he said.New grads face a tougher job marketAs young adults enter the real world, they are facing an increasingly tight labor market.According to a recent analysis of labor market conditions for recent college graduates by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, job opportunities ‚Äúdeteriorated noticeably in the first quarter of 2025.‚Äù Among this group, the unemployment rate jumped to 5.8% ‚Äî the highest reading since 2021.Although finance majors had higher salaries compared to most other majors, grads with nutrition, art history and philosophy degrees all outperformed both finance and STEM fields when it comes to employment prospects, the New York Fed found.For finance and computer science, the unemployment rate in those fields was 3.7% and 6.1%, respectively. By comparison, the unemployment rate for art history majors was 3%, and for nutritional sciences, the unemployment rate was just 0.4%, the New York Fed found.After notching significant gains since 2020, the rise of computer science majors came to a near standstill this year, other reports show, fueled by concerns that artificial intelligence is rapidly taking over jobs in the field.Economics majors also fared worse than majors such as theology and philosophy when it came to the employment rates for recent college graduates, according to the New York Fed. Philosophy majors have an unemployment rate of 3.2%, for example, and for economics, it‚Äôs 4.9%.The New York Fed‚Äôs report was based on Census data from 2023 and unemployment rates of recent college graduates.The disconnect between the New York Fed‚Äôs outcomes by major and the CFA survey findings ‚Äî which is based on perceptions ‚Äî is likely due in part to societal expectations, particularly from parents, Watkins said. ‚ÄúIt may possibly be parental guidance, as in, ‚Äògo for business,'‚Äù he said.Demand for humanities majors risesMeanwhile, demand for humanities majors is on the rise, and with good reason.At a conference last year, Robert Goldstein, the chief operating officer of BlackRock, the world‚Äôs biggest money manager, said the firm was adjusting its hiring strategy for recent grads. ‚ÄúWe have more and more conviction that we need people who majored in history, in English, and things that have nothing to do with finance or technology,‚Äù Goldstein said.This demand for liberal arts degrees is fueled by the rise of artificial intelligence, which drives the need for creative thinking and so-called soft skills. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a bit of a gold rush in AI, people who are adopting quickly are going to succeed quickly,‚Äù Watkins said.Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube.",2025-07-12 03:30:01+00:00

Here‚Äôs what to know about the so-called ‚Äúhot girl hamster wheel,‚Äù what‚Äôs behind it and how women can get ahead.There are many unique hurdles that women face when it comes to money, such as the wage gap and caregiving responsibilities.Yet, there‚Äôs another challenge in women‚Äôs financial lives that is less-discussed ‚Äî beauty costs, which can be an ‚Äúinsidious force in women‚Äôs financial lives,‚Äù said Katie Gatti Tassin, author of the new book ‚ÄúRich Girl Nation: Taking Charge of Our Financial Futures.‚ÄùMore from Personal Finance:She made up to $110,000 a year as a nanny for the ultra-richMost women investors share a common regret: reportWhat the Senate Republican tax, spending bill means for your moneyTassin, who is also the founder of ‚ÄúMoney with Katie,‚Äù describes beauty expenses as a ‚Äúhot girl hamster wheel.‚Äù There‚Äôs a whole industry dedicated to profiting on women‚Äôs insecurities, she said, and it shows up in women‚Äôs budgets. CNBC spoke with Tassin in late June about how women can escape the ‚Äúhot girl hamster wheel,‚Äù and what to do instead with their cash.(This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.)‚ÄòBeauty is a depreciating asset by design‚ÄôAna Teresa SolaÃÅ: The first chapter of your book talks about the so-called ‚Äúhot girl hamster wheel.‚Äù Can you describe what that is? Katie Gatti Tassin: The ‚Äúhot girl hamster wheel‚Äù is the collection of recurring expenses that are necessary to maintain what I like to call the ‚Äúacceptable feminine appearance.‚Äù Every single dollar that you spend will function like a commitment to keep spending more money in the future because of the nature of aesthetic enhancement: Your body is eventually going to reject all of these interventions that you‚Äôre making. Anybody who‚Äôs ever gotten acrylic nails is familiar with this struggle, where they grow out and then your nails underneath are brittle and discolored.ATS: What expenses fall under this type of spending? KGT: Typically, for most women, it‚Äôs hair, it‚Äôs nails, it‚Äôs skincare.Things that are more about form than function, is probably a good way to put it.Buying toothpaste does not count. Even though that‚Äôs still a personal care purchase, because the toothpaste is doing a job for you, it‚Äôs about hygiene. Whereas, Crest White Strips would probably count because this is something that you‚Äôre doing to intervene with how you look and how you are perceived.It can take a form that we accept as baseline feminine maintenance or upkeep, and that‚Äôs really what I want people to take a closer look at for themselves. Rich Girl Nation Book ReleaseATS: How does one fall prey to it? KGT: If you feel like the way that you look matters, that‚Äôs probably because you are accurately picking up on signals that it does. We know that ‚Äúpretty privilege‚Äù is real, and so I want to be careful not to insinuate that anyone who‚Äôs falling for this is being made a mark, or is reacting to forces that are completely fabricated or artificial. It is true that beautiful people are treated better and are accommodated. We know that. So in some ways, it‚Äôs a rational path to start walking down because you sense that there is some return on that investment. But what I want to bring people back to is, beauty is a depreciating asset by design. Unlike investing in actual capital ‚Äî which will grow with time, it will become more valuable ‚Äî when you invest in beauty, the opposite is happening. It‚Äôs going to require more and more cash to extend that half-life.‚ÄòBeauty is about power‚ÄôATS: It sounds like this is not by accident, particularly for women. Why is that? What dynamics are at play? KGT: I just had a wonderful interview on my show with a woman named Tressie McMillan Cottom [who is a sociologist and writer], and I think she really nailed it. She said beauty is about power. Beauty is the only power that women can wield; they can use it, but they can never own it.My perspective is that women are socialized to view beauty as the most powerful and important social capital that is worth their time to pursue.But I do think as individuals, we have the ability to positively influence one another and give one another permission to opt out ‚Äî and maybe you‚Äôre not opting out all the way. I think a lot of this does come down to survival. ATS: You mentioned in the book that the subject matter was ‚Äúmysteriously absent‚Äù from personal finance books and sites you‚Äôve frequented in the past. Why do you think that is?KGT: The majority of personal finance books and the majority of the personal finance field has historically been written by and for men, which means that men have shaped in subtle and overt ways this field with their experiences, their preferences and their priorities.By the way, I‚Äôm not knocking them. I learned a lot reading the men‚Äôs money blogs, but obviously they are not going to be able to guide me on, ‚ÄúHey, this is why your full highlights routine is making you broke.‚Äù It was just completely out of their scope of reference.How to ‚Äòhot girl detox‚ÄôATS: You provide a strategy to cut back on such expenses called the ‚Äúhot girl detox.‚Äù Is this useful to strike a balance?KGT: I think it‚Äôs a useful exercise for all the spending that you do. It‚Äôs just about giving yourself the gift of that insight by sitting down, doing the simple math and then getting curious and experimenting with, ‚ÄúIs this thing giving me the value that I want, and if it‚Äôs not, what could I try instead?‚ÄùYou list out all the beauty and personal care spending that you do in a given year, and you annualize those costs. You‚Äôre going to figure out how they relate back to what you‚Äôre bringing in income. You‚Äôre going to start at the bottom and experiment with removing one thing at a time and seeing how it feels.If you‚Äôre like me and many other women who have gone through this process, what you‚Äôre probably going to find is that you are going to get back not just an extraordinary amount of money, but time and mental energy, too.Investing is ‚Äòthe best gift that you can give yourself‚ÄôATS: Once the reader performs their detox, what should they do with the extra cash? KGT: The goal really is for that money to go to work for you and your future. What that‚Äôs going to look like will depend on the situation that you‚Äôre presently in.If you have a lot of high-interest debt, then the best thing for you to do with that money is to start attacking the debt.If you don‚Äôt have debt, but you also don‚Äôt really have any cash savings, then saving that money in a high-yield savings account and giving yourself that cash cushion is probably the next best step.If you‚Äôve done both of those things already, investing for your future is the best possible thing that you can do. It‚Äôs the best gift that you can give yourself.",2025-07-12 04:30:01+00:00

banknews,trump,World leaders respond to latest Trump tariff threats against the EU and Mexico,"President Donald Trump unveiled the new rates in letters to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and Mexico‚Äôs President Claudia Sheinbaum. Trump said that if the EU or Mexico retaliates with higher tariffs, ‚Äúthen, whatever the number you choose to raise them by, will be added on to the 30% that we charge.‚Äù The EU collectively sells more to the U.S. than any single country. President Donald Trump said Saturday the U.S. will impose a 30% tariff on goods from the Europe and Mexico that will take effect on Aug. 1.Trump revealed the new rates in letters to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and Mexico‚Äôs President Claudia Sheinbaum, which he posted on his social media site Truth Social.‚ÄúMexico has been helping me secure the border, BUT, what Mexico has done, is not enough,‚Äù Trump wrote to Sheinbaum.Trump said that there will not be tariffs on goods from the EU if the 27-member bloc, ‚Äúor companies within the EU, decide to build or manufacture product[s] within the United States,‚Äù he wrote.He said that if the EU or Mexico retaliates with higher tariffs, ‚Äúthen, whatever the number you choose to raise them by, will be added on to the 30% that we charge.‚ÄùThe EU was seeking at least a preliminary agreement that would spare it from becoming the latest recipient of a letter from Trump dictating a new, across-the-board tariff on its exports to the U.S.However, it still received a letter from Trump threatening new tariffs, despite both sides having recently signaled progress in their negotiations after Trump backed off a threat to slap 50% tariffs on the bloc.The EU collectively sells more to the U.S. than any single country: Total U.S. goods imports from the EU topped $553 billion in 2022, according to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative.Total U.S. imports from Mexico was roughly $454.8 billion in 2022, according to the U.S. Trade Representative. ‚ÄúImposing 30 percent tariffs on EU exports would disrupt essential transatlantic supply chains, to the detriment of businesses, consumers and patients on both sides of the Atlantic,‚Äù von der Leyen said in a statement.She said the EU remains ‚Äúready to continue working towards an agreement by August 1.‚Äù‚ÄúAt the same time, we will take all necessary steps to safeguard EU interests, including the adoption of proportionate countermeasures if required.‚ÄùTrump has sent similar letters to 23 other U.S. trading partners this week, including Canada, Japan and Brazil, setting blanket tariff rates ranging from 20% up to 50%.The letters mostly frame the new tariff levels as a necessary part of the Trump administration‚Äôs efforts to quickly establish a more ‚Äúreciprocal‚Äù global trade landscape.Trump had attempted to do that in one fell swoop with his ‚Äúliberation day‚Äù tariff announcement on April 2, when he imposed a nearly global 10% tariff and slapped higher duties on imports from nearly 60 individual countries.The announcement prompted days of frenzied selling in global markets. Trump put a 90-day pause on nearly all of the higher tariffs a week later.His trade officials suggested that the U.S. could strike as many as 90 new trade deals during that interval. But by the time the pause was set to expire on Wednesday, the administration had only hashed out preliminary agreements with the United Kingdom and Vietnam.Trump on Monday extended that tariff pause until Aug. 1. The tariff rates he set in his recent spate of letters are all scheduled to kick in on the same day.Trump told NBC News on Thursday that he plans to ratchet up his global tariff baseline rate as high as 20%.‚ÄúWe‚Äôre just going to say all of the remaining countries are going to pay, whether it‚Äôs 20% or 15%. We‚Äôll work that out now,‚Äù Trump said.This is breaking news. Please check back for updates.",2025-07-12 12:26:01+00:00

banknews,trump,Federal Reserve quietly responds to Trump administration attacks over renovation,"A new ‚ÄúFrequently Asked Questions‚Äù page on the Federal Reserve‚Äôs website defends the central bank‚Äôs recent renovation project ‚Äî and responds to many Trump administration criticisms of it. Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought slammed the renovation project and said he would pursue an investigation. Chairman Jerome Powell has repeatedly resisted President Donald Trump‚Äôs criticisms and repeated attempts to pressure him to raise interest rates.As the Trump administration escalates its criticisms of the Federal Reserve and Chairman Jerome Powell, the central bank is quietly pushing back with a new ‚ÄúFrequently Asked Questions‚Äù page on its website defending the central bank‚Äôs $2.5 billion renovation project.The page, last updated on Friday, directly responds to some of the administration‚Äôs criticisms of the project, which came under attack this week from Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought.Vought on Thursday claimed that Powell ‚Äúhas grossly mismanaged the Fed‚Äù and took aim at what he called ‚Äúan ostentatious overhaul‚Äù of the Fed‚Äôs renovations.Vought‚Äôs criticisms, made via a letter posted on X, marked an escalation of the Trump administration‚Äôs ongoing campaign against Powell. Trump has repeatedly claimed the central bank leader is playing politics by not lowering interest rates, and has called on Powell to resign.The letter ‚Äî and Vought‚Äôs Friday pledge to pursue an investigation into the Fed‚Äôs renovations ‚Äî suggest that the Trump administration is moving to remove Powell before his term ends next year.But Powell has repeatedly resisted Trump‚Äôs criticisms and repeated attempts to pressure him to cut interest rates, the main sticking point in Trump‚Äôs attacks.The Fed‚Äôs website defending the renovation project is the latest sign that the central bank is gearing up to fight against the Trump administration‚Äôs newest attacks.‚ÄúNo new VIP dining rooms are being constructed as part of the project,‚Äù the FAQs page on the website says.‚ÄúEccles has conference rooms, which are being renovated and preserved. They are also used for mealtime meetings,‚Äù the post says of the building.That line appears to be in direct response to Vought‚Äôs letter, which claimed that the plans for renovations called ‚Äúfor rooftop terrace gardens, VIP private dining rooms and elevators, water features, premium marble, and much more.‚ÄùThe FAQ page outlines ‚Äúthe main reasons for cost increases over the course of the project,‚Äù which has been a major line of attack for Trump allies.The cost of the construction is estimated to be about $700 million over budget.‚ÄúVarious factors have driven cost increases,‚Äù the page on the Federal Reserve website says, citing ‚Äúchanges to original building designs as a result of consultation with review agencies‚Äù and ‚Äúunforeseen conditions,‚Äù such as ‚Äúmore asbestos than anticipated.‚ÄùTaxpayers do not foot the bill for the cost of the renovations. The Fed is self-funded through interest it makes on securities held by the institution and through fees charged banks. Trump loses appeal of $5 million E.

banknews,trump,Trump threatens to revoke comedian Rosie O'Donnell's citizenship,"President Donald Trump called Rosie O‚ÄôDonnell a ‚Äúthreat to humanity,‚Äù and said she should stay in Ireland, which is where the comedian moved after Trump‚Äôs re-election. O‚ÄôDonnell has been an outspoken Trump critic, and the two have had a long, bitter feud. O‚ÄôDonnell shot back against Trump‚Äôs social media post with one of her own, saying Trump is going to ‚Äúdeport all who stand against‚Äù his ‚Äúevil tendencies.‚ÄùPresident Donald Trump said Saturday that he is considering revoking comedian Rosie O‚ÄôDonnell‚Äôs citizenship, a dramatic escalation of Trump‚Äôs threats to use the executive branch to target his opponents.‚ÄúBecause of the fact that Rosie O‚ÄôDonnell is not in the best interests of our Great Country, I am giving serious consideration to taking away her Citizenship,‚Äù Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social.He called O‚ÄôDonnell a ‚Äúthreat to humanity‚Äù and said that she should ‚Äúremain in the wonderful Country of Ireland,‚Äù which is where she currently resides.O‚ÄôDonnell moved to Ireland in January following Trump‚Äôs re-election.There is no legal precedent for a president revoking the citizenship of a U.S.-born citizen, and such a move has no legal basis under current law.It‚Äôs not the first time that Trump has mentioned an opponent‚Äôs U.S. citizenship in a not-so-subtle threat.Trump earlier this month falsely questioned the citizenship of Zohran Mamdani, who won New York City‚Äôs Democratic mayoral primary.

Beyond payment integration, the two companies will collaborate on promotional campaigns to raise awareness and drive user adoption once the service goes live.Crypto.com Pay integration set for Q4 2025A Crypto.com spokesperson confirmed to Cointelegraph that the integration is set for the last quarter of the year. ‚ÄúThe initial phase will focus on technical readiness, compliance alignment, and customer experience mapping,‚Äù the spokesperson said.Furthermore, Emirates and Crypto.com will determine whether the rollout will begin on select routes, regional markets, or through a global launch, with pilot phases likely to precede wider implementation.The spokesperson also confirmed that crypto payments from customers will be converted instantly to fiat (AED) using real-time exchange rates at the point of transaction. ‚ÄúEmirates will not hold any cryptocurrency on its books; settlements will occur in AED, ensuring compliance and minimal FX exposure,‚Äù they said.Crypto.com also said it continues to explore regional and international airline integrations as part of a broader travel and commerce strategy. ‚ÄúThe goal is to build a universal crypto travel layer bringing seamless, secure, and compliant payment experiences to travelers across air, retail and hospitality sectors.‚ÄùDubai eyes leadership in cryptoThe integration comes amid Dubai‚Äôs push to lead in crypto, as the city seeks to establish itself as a primary hub for blockchain and digital asset projects.Backed by regulatory clarity and a pro-innovation environment, several industries in the emirate, from real estate to telecommunications, have already opened their doors to cryptocurrency payments.Earlier this year, Tether partnered with UAE-based Reelly Tech to expand the use of its USDt stablecoin in real estate transactions. The deal allows buyers to use USDt to purchase property through 30,000 Reelly Tech agents globally.Last month, the Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA), the financial regulator in charge of the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC), approved Ripple‚Äôs RLUSD stablecoin. DIFC companies can now use the RLUSD stablecoin for various virtual asset services.The Dubai Multi Commodities Centre free zone has attracted over 600 crypto companies, with more firms flocking to the Dubai International Financial Centre and One Central district as the country positions itself as a leader in digital finance.Dubai eyes leadership in cryptoDubai‚Äôs real estate market reached new highs in May, with sales totaling 66.8 billion dirhams (around $18.2 billion) across 18,700 transactions, a 44% increase in value year-on-year. The surge came amid an accelerating push into real estate tokenization.In May alone, multiple initiatives, including a $3 billion RWA deal involving MultiBank Group, real estate giant MAG and blockchain infrastructure provider Mavryk, were launched by government and industry players.On May 19, the Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority, Dubai‚Äôs crypto regulator, updated its guidelines to include provisions for real-world asset (RWA) tokenization. Lawyer Irina Heaver told Cointelegraph these rules give issuers and exchanges a clear path to launch and trade tokenized real estate assets.

Over the past week, the number of registered XRP users on BJMINING has surged by 300%. By converting idle XRP into mining power, users are unlocking a new passive income stream‚Äîearning up to $7,500 per day‚Äîwhile still retaining the benefits of traditional token holding. This trend highlights a deeper integration between the XRP ecosystem and next-generation financial tools, especially amid accelerating regulatory momentum.Why Are XRP Holders Worldwide Choosing BJMINING?Regulatory Breakthroughs Drive Asset Growth OpportunitiesRipple's application for a banking license marks a major milestone for XRP's legitimacy in traditional financial markets.

banknews,a,Can Jay Powell Make It Through The Weekend?,"Can Jay Powell Make It Through The Weekend? Authored by Larry Kudlow via RealClearPolitics.com,Is the Fed chairman, Jay Powell, going to make it through the weekend? There is talk that he is being forced to resign....President Trump, of course, is on his case daily for not dropping interest rates in line with low inflation.Late yesterday, the head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency that regulates Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and oversees the 11 federal home loan banks, William Pulte, issued a statement, saying: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm encouraged by reports that Jerome Powell is considering resigning. I think this will be the right decision for America, and the economy will boom.‚ÄùYesterday, the Office of Management and Budget‚Äôs director, Russ Vought, condemned Mr. Powell for his gross mismanagement of what Mr. Vought calls the palace of Versailles. Mr. Vought said: ‚ÄúWe saw Chairman Powell. He was too late to recognize inflation, and now he‚Äôs too late to lower rates. And the Fed has just mismanaged the institution. And we see that the extent to which they‚Äôve been operating at losses for a number of years now is for the first time in their history.‚Äù He added: ‚ÄúAnd then you just see a very practical example when you go to the nation‚Äôs mall. You see the construction of this palace, in the words of one former official, upwards of $2.5 billion, massive cost overrun.‚ÄùAnd this $2.5 billion monstrosity of Mr. Powell‚Äôs is already over budget by $700 million.Mr. Vought second-guessed Mr. Powell‚Äôs Senate testimony that there‚Äôs no VIP dining room, no new marble, no special elevators, no new water features, no bee hives, and no roof terrace garden in the Fed‚Äôs renovated office complex.Mr. Vought noted that the Fed‚Äôs Taj Mahal is way out of compliance with the National Capital Planning Act.Mr. Powell has long argued that he can‚Äôt be replaced except ‚Äúfor cause.‚ÄùYet this kind of blatant financial mismanagement over the Fed‚Äôs new building and the renovations of the old building ‚Äî mismanagement that Mr. Powell denied under oath ‚Äî could well represent sufficient ‚Äúcause‚Äù to force his resignation, or even be fired by Mr. Trump.Meanwhile, economists are pointing out that the Fed is hemorrhaging cash as its interest expenses exceed interest taken in.And their $6 trillion-plus bond portfolio is underwater by $1.1 trillion.This has all the earmarks of the bankruptcy of the Silicon Valley Bank, that went under in March of 2023 ‚Äî and almost pulled the financial system down with it.So, now the question is: Can Mr. Powell even make it through the weekend?

banknews,s,Tariff Windfall Drives Surprise $27 Billion US Budget Surplus In June,"Tariff Windfall Drives Surprise $27 Billion US Budget Surplus In June Authored by Tom Ozimek via The Epoch Times,New data from the Treasury Department show that surging tariff revenues in June helped the U.S. government post an unexpected budget surplus of $27 billion, offering a rare fiscal bright spot amid persistently high federal deficits and suggesting that President Donald Trump‚Äôs tariff policies are becoming a significant source of government revenue.After running a $316 billion deficit in May, the government recorded a surplus of just over $27 billion last month, according to data released on July 11 by the Treasury Department. The tariff windfall helped narrow the fiscal year-to-date deficit to $1.34 trillion‚Äîa slight 1 percent improvement from the same period last year. By contrast, June 2024 saw a $71 billion deficit.A key driver of the improved balance was a record-breaking surge in customs duties. The Treasury data released on Friday show that tariff collections soared to $27 billion in June alone, pushing total tariff revenues since October to $108 billion‚Äîthe highest ever recorded for the first nine months of a fiscal year. June‚Äôs haul marked a significant jump from May‚Äôs prior record of $22 billion and was about 93 percent higher than the $56 billion collected during the same nine-month span of the previous year.So far in July, customs duties have added another $2.4 billion to federal coffers, according to daily Treasury figures.Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has predicted even higher tariff revenues in the months ahead. Speaking at a July 8 White House Cabinet meeting, he said the United States is on track to collect $300 billion by the end of calendar year 2025, noting that the ‚Äúmajor‚Äù tariffs imposed under the Trump administration did not start until the second quarter.Since returning to the White House for a second term, Trump has imposed 10 percent universal tariffs on trading partners, along with reciprocal tariffs announced in April on a number of nations, depending on the trade barriers they have with the United States. Trump initially applied a 90-day pause to most of the reciprocal tariffs, and later signed an executive order that extended the reprieve to Aug. 1.In recent days, the president sent letters to several countries‚Äîincluding Japan, South Korea, and Thailand‚Äîinforming them that reciprocal tariffs ranging from 25 to 40 percent will be imposed after Aug. 1 unless they agree to reduce trade barriers and negotiate bilateral deals.Trump has said the higher duties will substantially boost government revenue.‚ÄúThe big money will start coming in on Aug. 1st. I think it was made clear today by the letters that were sent out yesterday and today,‚Äù he said during the Cabinet meeting.Bessent also cited a June 4 report from the Congressional Budget Office projecting that tariff revenues could total $2.8 trillion over the next decade‚Äîa figure he said the administration believes is understated.Trump said he won‚Äôt extend the Aug. 1 deadline for countries to start paying reciprocal tariffs, signaling a firm stance after earlier suggesting flexibility for nations offering trade concessions.In one recent round of letters, Trump announced new tariffs as follows: 25 percent on Japan, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, South Korea, and Tunisia; 30 percent on Bosnia and Herzegovina and South Africa; 32 percent on Indonesia; 35 percent on Bangladesh and Serbia; 36 percent on Cambodia and Thailand; and 40 percent on Burma (also known as Myanmar) and Laos.In each letter, Trump noted that the tariffs might be lowered if countries open their markets and reduce non-tariff barriers, emphasizing that persistent trade deficits pose ‚Äúa major threat‚Äù to U.S. economic and national security.More recently, Trump sent another round of letters, noting that Algeria, Iraq, Libya, and Sri Lanka will each be charged a 30 percent tariff, Brunei and Moldova will face a 25 percent tariff, and the Philippines will face a 20 percent tariff.The president has also announced that Canada will face 35 percent tariffs starting on Aug. 1.

banknews,trump,"Newborns To Get $1,000 'Trump Accounts' - Here's How It Works","Newborns To Get $1,000 'Trump Accounts' - Here's How It Works Authored by Andrew Moran via The Epoch Times,The Republican reconciliation package, better known as the One Big Beautiful Bill, introduced Trump Accounts for newborns, which were previously dubbed MAGA Accounts, or ‚ÄúMoney Account for Growth and Advancement.‚ÄùThe accounts are new tax-advantaged investment vehicles comparable to individual retirement accounts, prefunded with $1,000 from the Treasury Department for every child born between Jan. 1, 2025, and Dec. 31, 2028. Children born before this year will also be eligible, but not for the initial $1,000 seed money.Parents will be eligible to contribute up to $5,000 annually, including up to $2,500 tax-free from a parent‚Äôs employer. The money must be invested in a broad stock market index, and earnings will grow tax-deferred until the account holder withdraws the funds.As part of the new pilot program, parents must have Social Security numbers and be authorized to work in the United States. Families can choose to open a Trump Account at a financial institution, or the federal government will automatically enroll eligible children upon tax filing, with the option to opt out. There are no income requirements.‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a pro-family initiative that will help millions of Americans harness the strength of our economy to lift up the next generation, and they‚Äôll really be getting a big jump on life,‚Äù President Donald Trump stated at a June 9 White House event. Economists say the children will likely profit from the U.S. stock market‚Äôs upward trajectory.One paper by the Milken Institute estimates that $1,000 accounts would balloon in value over time. After 20 years, researchers project that they will increase to more than $8,000.This is plausible. Over the last 20 years, for instance, the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average has risen more than 300 percent.Once beneficiaries turn 18, they can withdraw half of the funds for ‚Äúqualified purposes,‚Äù such as paying for tuition, job training, buying a first home, or starting a business. If the money is used for non-qualified expenditures, it will be taxed as ordinary income.At age 25, they can access the full balance for specific reasons‚Äîa non-qualified expense would be taxed as ordinary income. After the account holder turns 31, the account is terminated, and the full balance can be withdrawn for any purpose; a long-term capital gains tax is then applied.What Is Being Said About Trump AccountsExperts say the program will encourage saving for a child‚Äôs future, promote financial literacy, and reduce wealth inequality.‚ÄúThe program could also increase financial literacy of participants and their parents, which in turn would likely increase savings rates and wealth creation,‚Äù the Milken Institute paper said. ‚ÄúSince all newborns would receive the grants, the program would reduce wealth inequality.‚ÄùCritics say that it does little to assist new parents.The Institute for Family Studies says that Trump Accounts do little to help families in the early years of parenthood, ‚Äúwhen incomes are variable and expenses higher.‚Äù‚ÄúThis is a policy that aims to boost the amount of savings held by teenagers, which may or may not be a laudable goal, but is far from a targeted pro-family approach,‚Äù the group said in a report.Economists say it adds yet another layer to an already complex landscape of savings account options.‚ÄúThe tax code provides for at least 11 tax-advantaged savings vehicles, each with different rules, limitations, and regulations,‚Äù Tax Foundation economists said in a June 11 report.Wall Street in New York City on April 4, 2025. Samira Bouaou/The Epoch TimesFor example, a popular savings instrument for families is the 529 college savings plan. This program is designed specifically to cover the costs of attending college or university, such as tuition, fees, books, and room and board. Additionally, 529s offer various other features, including no annual limit, tax-free growth, and no age cap.Ultimately, a Trump Account would offer more flexibility for general wealth-building while 529 plans are targeted for education savings.‚ÄúThe addition of the Trump Accounts would further complicate savings for taxpayers who would have to keep track of yet another account,‚Äù the Tax Foundation economists said.Instead, the government could offer universal tax-neutral savings accounts for taxpayers, they said.Corporate America Pledges SupportSeveral companies have already pledged to participate in the savings account plan.Michael Dell, CEO of Dell Technologies, said at a June White House business roundtable event that his company will match the government‚Äôs contributions ‚Äúdollar for dollar to every child born to a Dell team.‚Äù‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt just a new investment,‚Äù Dell said in a statement. ‚ÄúThis is an investment in our people, their families, our communities, and America‚Äôs future. And it embodies our core belief that opportunity should begin at birth.‚ÄùGoldman Sachs CEO David Solomon, Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi, and Altimeter Capital CEO Brad Gerstner also voiced support for the program.‚ÄúWhen everyone realizes they can be an owner, it unites our country around free-market principles and unleashes the next generation of American success,‚Äù Gerstner said.

Now, it appears that Jackson‚Äôs increasingly controversial opinions are serving a certain cathartic purpose for the far-left Biden appointee.On ABC News, Jackson stated, ‚ÄúI just feel that I have a wonderful opportunity to tell people in my opinions how I feel about the issues, and that‚Äôs what I try to do.‚ÄùHer colleagues have not entirely welcomed that sense of license.The histrionic and hyperbolic rhetoric has increased in Jackson‚Äôs opinions, which at times portray her colleagues as abandoning not just the Constitution but democracy itself.Her dissent in the recent ruling on universal injunctions drew the rebuke of Justice Amy Coney Barrett over what was described as ‚Äúa vision of the judicial role that would make even the most ardent defender of judicial supremacy blush.‚Äù Barrett wrote:‚ÄúWe will not dwell on Justice Jackson‚Äôs argument, which is at odds with more than two centuries‚Äô worth of precedent, not to mention the Constitution itself. We observe only this: Justice Jackson decries an imperial Executive while embracing an imperial Judiciary.‚ÄùJackson, however, clearly feels that opinions are a way for her to opine on issues of the day.She is not alone. Across the country, liberal judges have been adding their own commentary to decisions in condemning Trump, his supporters, and his policies.I previously wrote about this pattern of extrajudicial commentary.District Court Judge Tanya Chutkan, an Obama appointee, was criticized for failing to recuse herself from that case after she made highly controversial statements about Trump from the bench. Chutkan lashed out at ‚Äúa blind loyalty to one person who, by the way, remains free to this day.‚Äù That ‚Äúone person‚Äù was still under investigation at the time, and when Trump was charged, Chutkan refused to let the case go.Later, Chutkan again added her own commentary when asked to dismiss a case due to Trump pardoning Jan. 6 defendants. She acknowledged that she could not block the pardons but proclaimed that the pardons could not change the ‚Äútragic truth‚Äù and ‚Äúcannot whitewash the blood, feces and terror that the mob left in its wake. And it cannot repair the jagged breach in America‚Äôs sacred tradition of peacefully transitioning power.‚ÄùOne of Chutkan‚Äôs colleagues, Judge Beryl Howell, also an Obama appointee, lashed out at Trump‚Äôs actions, writing, ‚Äú[T]his Court cannot let stand the revisionist myth relayed in this presidential pronouncement.‚ÄùThen there is Judge Amit Mehta, another Obama appointee, who has been criticized for conflicted rulings in Trump cases and his bizarre (and ultimately abandoned) effort to banish January 6th defendants from the Capitol.Last week, Mehta had a straightforward question of jurisdiction concerning a challenge to the denial of grants by the Trump Administration. While correctly dismissing the challenge, Mehta decided to add his own commentary on Trump‚Äôs priorities and policies:‚ÄúDefendants‚Äô rescinding of these awards is shameful. It is likely to harm communities and individuals vulnerable to crime and violence. But displeasure and sympathy are not enough in a court of law.‚ÄùFor Justice Jackson, her opinions have at times left her isolated on the Court. Weeks ago, Jackson and Sotomayor were alone in dissent over the defiance of a district court judge of the Court‚Äôs decision on universal injunctions. To her credit, Justice Elena Kagan (who voted with Sotomayor and Jackson in dissent in the earlier case) voted with her conservative colleagues in rebuking Judge Brian Murphy in Boston.Kagan joined in the reversal of Murphy‚Äôs conflicting order and wrote the new order ‚Äúclarifies only one thing: Other litigants must follow the rules, but the administration has the Supreme Court on speed dial.‚ÄùThis week, Jackson lost even Sotomayor and stood alone in her dissent in support of an injunction over plans to downsize the government. Sotomayor observed that the Trump order only ordered for agencies to plan for such downsizing and said that the courts could hardly enjoin such policy preparations in the Executive Branch.However, Jackson could and would.The controversial position of Jackson on the Court is not due to her liberal views. We have had many such liberal jurists. The difference is how Jackson views her role as a justice.The danger is not confined to opinions. For years, justices have yielded to the temptations of public speaking before supportive groups. I have long been a critic of what I called the era of ‚Äúcelebrity justices‚Äù where members seem to maintain political constituencies in public events.Such speeches can not only undermine the integrity of the Court by discussing matters that may come before it, but they can create a desire to maintain the adoration of supporters. The greatest danger is that justices will consciously or subconsciously pander to their bases with soundbites and inflammatory rhetoric.Judicial advocacy from the bench has been a concern since the founding. Article III can have a corrosive impact on certain jurists who come to view themselves as anointed rather than appointed. Most judges and justices are acutely aware of that danger and struggle to confine their rulings to the merits of disputes, avoiding political questions or commentary.The ‚Äúopportunity to tell people how I feel‚Äù can become a slippery slope where opinions become more like judicial op-eds. The Court is not a cable show. The price of the ticket to being ‚Äúone of nine‚Äù is that you should speak only through your opinions and only on the narrow legal matter before you.Opinions must remain ‚Äúopportunities‚Äù to do simple justice, not a supreme editorial.Jonathan Turley is the Shapiro Professor of Public Interest Law at George Washington University and the best-selling author of ‚ÄúThe Indispensable Right.‚Äù Tyler DurdenSat, 07/12/2025 - 17:30",2025-07-12 21:30:00+00:00

(NASDAQ:RYTM), a global commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on transforming the lives of patients living with rare neuroendocrine diseases, today announced data from three new presentations on the Company's clinical programs for acquired hypothalamic obesity at the Endocrine Society's Annual Meeting (ENDO 2025) taking place July 12-15 in San Francisco, CA.Acquired hypothalamic obesity is a rare but serious condition caused by damage to the hypothalamic region of the brain, which includes the melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R) pathway. This damage, often from brain tumors or their treatment, leads to rapid weight gain, hyperphagia, and low energy expenditure. Presentations on Rhythm's acquired hypothalamic obesity programs at ENDO 2025 include:Efficacy and Safety of Once-Daily Oral Bivamelagon in Acquired Hypothalamic Obesity: Results from a Double-blind, Multicenter, Placebo-Controlled, Randomized Phase 2 TrialIn a poster presentation, Vidhu Thaker, M.D., Pediatric Endocrinology, Columbia University, New York City, presented data from the Phase 2 SIGNAL trial evaluating bivamelagon, a daily oral, highly selective MC4R agonist, in patients with acquired hypothalamic obesity. In the 14-week, double-blind, four-arm, placebo-controlled portion of the trial, bivamelagon achieved statistically significant and clinically meaningful reductions in body mass index (BMI), consistent with BMI reductions achieved with setmelanotide therapy in similar patient populations in past trials. Other highlights include:-9.3% BMI reduction from baseline in the 600mg cohort (n=8) (p-value= 0.0004);-7.7% BMI reduction from baseline in the 400mg cohort (n=7) (p-value= 0.0002);-2.7% BMI reduction from baseline in the 200mg cohort (n=6) (p-value= 0.0180); andBMI for patients in the placebo cohort (n=7) increased by 2.2% over 14 weeks.""Patients with acquired hypothalamic obesity struggle with accelerated weight gain that profoundly affects their life. These data demonstrate bivamelagon's potential as a transformative therapeutic option for patients and validate the potential opportunity for MC4R targeted therapies, if approved, to become the standard of care for this patient community,"" said Vidhu Thaker, M.D., Associate Professor, Pediatric Endocrinology and Molecular Genetics, Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York City.Efficacy and Safety of Setmelanotide in Acquired Hypothalamic Obesity: Results from a Double-Blind, Multicenter, Placebo-Controlled, Randomized Phase 3 TrialIn a live oral presentation, Susan Phillips, M.D., Pediatric Endocrinology, University of California San Diego/Rady Children's Hospital, San Diego, presented data from Rhythm's pivotal Phase 3 TRANSCEND trial evaluating setmelanotide, the largest randomized, placebo-controlled trial in acquired hypothalamic obesity to date.

This ‚Äî together with the war ‚Äî are absolutely totally part of the same equation, despite the fact that not one in a 100 folks will ever know it or realize it, and for that very reason it will progress. Here is the problem...The US government has quietly initiated a stealth liquidity backdoor for banks by easing capital requirements on Treasury trades. This means:Banks no longer need to reserve as much capital when holding or trading US government debt, making banks dodgier than they already are.They can now soak up more Treasury issuance without showing increased risk on their balance sheets, making banks dodgier than they already are.This injects artificial demand into the Treasury market and helps paper over collapsing organic demand while making banks dodgier than they already are.This is not a mere policy shift. It‚Äôs a quiet declaration of structural stress.What this really means is that the Treasury market, the backbone of the current financial system, is now so fragile and overburdened with issuance that it can no longer function without regulatory distortion.The US government is now issuing a whopping $1‚Äì2 trillion in new debt every quarter.Foreign buyers like China and Japan are net sellers.Domestic demand for treasuries is not keeping up.Yields are becoming increasingly unhinged from real risk.I‚Äôd always thought they‚Äôd tap the boomers‚Äô capital sitting in pension funds, mandating percentages to be allocated to ‚Äúsafety‚Äù or some such hogwash, but this is a new one that I admit I did not see coming ‚Äî they‚Äôre turning banks into forced buyers by changing the rules. Sneaky buggers!It won‚Äôt be called yield curve control, but this is exactly what it is... and it stinks of desperation.So where does the Iran distraction come in? Exactly here:War is a cover for liquidity expansion. War equals narrative control. War is a moral justification for massive capital deployment. And war means optical deferral of systemic accountability (they screwed up biggie, but can‚Äôt admit to it, because by doing so we‚Äôd get a revolution). Far better to send the peasants into a meat grinder (worked in Ukraine).The Iran ‚Äúsurprise‚Äù hype machine serves a dual purpose:Emotionally spike public attention away from the fact that the US is suffering from domestic insolvency.Creates a narrative for justifying increased military spending and debt expansion, all under the guise of national security. The deep state truly is in control.They‚Äôre not trying to hide the debt anymore. They‚Äôre trying to normalize the next phase of collapse by staging urgency elsewhere.The United States is entering a phase where the legitimacy of the dollar system depends entirely on manufacturing belief. And when belief wanes, control mechanisms shift from fiscal logic to memetic warfare.This is why capital rules are being gutted in silence, all the while state media channels scream about ‚Äúworld-changing surprises‚Äù (Trump‚Äôs Big Beautiful Bill) and existential threats (Russia bad, Iran bad, yadda, yadda, yadda). It is simply another step in the process of a failing empire.* * *As the fog of war thickens and financial smoke screens grow more elaborate, understanding the real drivers behind the chaos is no longer optional ‚Äî it‚Äôs essential.

Elsewhere, the G20 meetings in South Africa next week come at an interesting time for the country. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is not expected to attend. It comes after a meeting between the South African President and his U.S. counterpart went spectacularly wrong back in May.Earnings season always seems to roll around with alarming frequency.The newsroom approaches each quarter with a nervous energy, but this summer it feels especially heightened. Recent market records in both the U.S. and Europe, alongside an unpredictable economic environment, paint a complicated picture for the second half.It all kicks off on Tuesday with America‚Äôs banking behemoths, as attention switches from the White House back to Wall Street.But U.S. President Donald Trump‚Äôs policies still loom large, with Goldman Sachs predicting that, this quarter, U.S. earnings will start to show the impact of the tariffs.The investment bank‚Äôs economists see ‚Äúconflicting messages on the margin outlook‚Äù as companies have only announced modest price increases, despite the cost hikes associated with higher tariffs.Earnings-per-share growth is also set to come under pressure, with Goldman suggesting, ‚Äúthe consensus estimate among analysts sees S&P 500 companies‚Äô earnings-per-share growth decelerating to 4% this quarter relative to the same quarter last year ‚Äî down from 12% in the first quarter.‚ÄùWith the banks set to dominate next week ‚Äî JPMorgan, Citi, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Bank of America are all reporting within just two days ‚Äî maybe Europe can provide some optimism.As reported by CNBC‚Äôs Jenni Reid, European banks just recorded their best first half since 1997.

banknews,trump,10 Non-Tax Policies In Trump's Megabill That Will Affect Americans,"10 Non-Tax Policies In Trump's Megabill That Will Affect Americans Authored by Jackson Richman, Joseph Lord, Jacob Burg via The Epoch Times,The One Big Beautiful Bill Act is notable for implementing significant changes to the U.S. tax code, including making 2017‚Äôs individual income tax brackets permanent.But there are non-tax-related items in the bill that will impact the lives of everyday Americans, affecting travel, women‚Äôs health care, immigration, and welfare benefits.Here are ten major non-tax areas that are addressed in the legislation, which President Donald Trump signed into law on July 4.Air Traffic ControlThe new law provides $12.5 billion to the Transportation Department to institute long-overdue reforms to the nation‚Äôs air traffic control system.That includes $4.75 billion to upgrade copper telecommunication infrastructure to fiber optics, $3 billion for radar systems replacements, $500 million for safety technology to avoid near-misses on runways, and $100 million for advanced training technology for air traffic controllers.At a July 8 cabinet meeting, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy called the funding a ‚Äúmassive new start to rebuild air traffic control,‚Äù but said his agency will need more money to upgrade American aviation and make it the world‚Äôs leader.Duffy has repeatedly pointed to the Federal Aviation Administration‚Äôs outdated technology and infrastructure, which still relies on floppy disks, aging copper wire, and rotary phones.Despite the need for more funds, the bill could help reduce and avoid the sorts of delays that infamously bogged down Newark International Airport in New Jersey earlier this year.Air traffic controllers monitor planes at Los Angeles International Airport in Los Angeles on July 1, 2025. Under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the Transportation Department will receive $12.5 billion to implement long-overdue reforms to the U.S. air traffic control system. John Fredricks/The Epoch TimesBorder and ImmigrationThe legislation dedicates a total of $150 billion toward border security and immigration enforcement, aligning with some of Trump‚Äôs core promises on the 2024 campaign trail.Approximately $80 billion of that amount is slated for domestic immigration enforcement operations.The single biggest immigration item in the law is $46.5 billion dedicated to the construction of a border wall along the U.S.‚ÄìMexico border.Much of the rest is slated for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the agency largely responsible for carrying out Trump‚Äôs mass deportation operation.That includes $45 billion allocated for detention through September 2029‚Äîa 365 percent increase over ICE‚Äôs prior annual detention funding, which sat at $3.4 billion, according to the American Immigration Council. It provides $14.4 billion for transportation and removal operations, a 500 percent annual increase.For state and local governments that assist with deportation efforts, $13.5 billion is allocated in grants.Border Patrol agents monitor the U.S. border wall in San Ysidro, Calif., on July 25, 2024. The new legislation allocates $150 billion for border security and immigration enforcement. John Fredricks/The Epoch TimesEducationThe bill makes several notable tweaks to federal education policy.First, it would reduce Pell Grant eligibility for high-income students and students with full-ride scholarships. The approximately $7,000 annual grant has long provided a boost to funding Americans‚Äô higher education.The bill also proposes two federal student loan repayment plans, including one traditional repayment plan and one income-based repayment plan, as Republicans seek to do away with President Joe Biden‚Äôs contested Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) plan.Additionally, it would tax college and university endowments at a variable rate‚Äîeither 1.4 percent, 4 percent, or 8 percent‚Äîbased on the institutions‚Äô wealth.Medicaid and Rural HospitalsSome of the changes that have drawn the most attention are those made to Medicaid funding‚Äîchanges that are expected to boot millions of beneficiaries off the entitlement program while potentially impacting rural hospitals.To reduce Medicaid spending, the bill would impose an 80-hour monthly work requirement for able-bodied adults to receive benefits; the change would take effect by no later than December 2026.It also reduces the ‚Äúprovider tax‚Äù‚Äîthe rate at which states tax hospitals and doctors to pay for their Medicaid programs‚Äîfrom 6 percent to 3.5 percent in states that expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. Ten states that didn‚Äôt expand their programs will see no changes. That change won‚Äôt go into effect until 2028.To offset fears that the changes would harm rural hospitals, the bill allocates $50 billion over five years to support such facilities.Estimates vary significantly as to how many individuals could lose coverage as a result of the Medicaid changes. The Congressional Budget Office forecasts that several million nationwide could lose coverage.A man waits in a hospital in Irvine, Calif., on July 8, 2025. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act includes changes that could remove millions from Medicaid and impact rural hospitals. John Fredricks/The Epoch TimesSNAP CutsThe One Big Beautiful Bill Act includes new requirements for recipients of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), better known as food stamps.In addition, the bill introduces more stringent work requirements for SNAP recipients. Currently, able-bodied recipients between 18‚Äì54 must spend 80 hours a month volunteering, working, looking for a job, or being in school. The bill widens that window to between 18-64 years of age.Moreover, states will have to shoulder more of the burden when it comes to funding for SNAP. That means recipients could receive less in food stamps or lose access entirely, depending on the state in which they live.‚ÄòTrump Accounts‚Äô for NewbornsThe bill also adds a pilot program for ‚ÄúTrump Accounts,‚Äù a type of federal trust account that comes prefunded with $1,000 from the Treasury Department for every child born between Jan. 1, 2025, and Dec. 31, 2028. Children born before this year will also be eligible, but not for the initial $1,000 seed money.The scheme allows Americans to contribute up to $5,000 a year to these accounts.The money must be invested in a broad stock market index, and earnings will grow tax-deferred until the account holder withdraws the funds. Beneficiaries are eligible to withdraw half the money for qualified purposes when they reach the age of 18, and can access the full balance at age 25. Withdrawals would then be subject to either capital gains or income tax rates, depending on the nature of the expense.Expenses such as tuition, a first home purchase, or small business expenses would be subject to the lower capital gains tax rate; all other uses of the funds would be subject to normal income tax rates, including an additional 10 percent penalty for nonqualified expenses.People walk on the Lehigh University campus in Bethlehem, Pa., on Oct. 25, 2024. The legislation will affect higher education by reducing student grants and adjusting loan repayment plans and tax codes for institutions. Madalina Vasiliu/The Epoch TimesSpectrumOne section of the bill reinstates the Federal Communications Commission‚Äôs spectrum authority, a term that describes the agency‚Äôs ability to auction off specific radio frequencies to the private sector.The authority expired in 2023 and, with limited direction from the Biden administration, became deadlocked in Congress.The reauthorization of the program in the bill will generate $85 billion in revenues for the federal government over the next ten years, enables expansion of 5G and 6G mobile networks, and will allow for rural areas to receive radio communications that could be crucial during natural disasters in which they might not have access to TV.Defunding Planned ParenthoodThe One Big Beautiful Bill Act ends Medicaid funding for Planned Parenthood for one year. Stripping federal funding from Planned Parenthood, which provides reproductive health services such as abortion, has been a longtime goal of conservatives.A Planned Parenthood facility in Anaheim, Calif., on Sept. 10, 2020. The new legislation ends Medicaid funding for health care nonprofits that post more than $800,000 in profit in a year, including Planned Parenthood. John Fredricks/The Epoch TimesThe legislation does not explicitly mention Planned Parenthood, but instead references abortion providers that are non-profits and received more than $800,000 in Medicaid reimbursements in fiscal year 2023.A federal judge has since put that aspect of the legislation on hold pending further litigation.Obamacare ChangesThe law also makes several substantial changes to the Affordable Care Act (ACA), often known as ‚ÄúObamacare.‚Äù The ACA Marketplace allows low-income Americans to buy discounted health insurance.First, the legislation will require marketplace customers to re-enroll every year, much as some employees are required to reconfirm their chosen coverage for an employer-sponsored health insurance plan. During the re-enrollment process, customers will also have to re-verify their income.It also shortens the open enrollment period‚Äîwhich was lengthened under Biden‚Äîby returning the period to the original Nov. 1 to Dec. 15 window.Other provisions of the law exclude gender transition treatment from coverage, limit Marketplace tax credits to citizens and some lawful residents, and require enrollees to be current on their premium payments before re-enrolling for another year.The changes will be implemented on a rolling basis, with some related to eligibility set to go into effect as early as December 2025.A group of resident doctors talks with a senior doctor inside Brookdale University Hospital and Medical Center in the Brooklyn borough of New York City on July 1, 2025. Andres Kudacki/AP PhotoExpansion of Military Housing and Support ProgramsThe One Big Beautiful Bill Act includes a $9 billion expansion of programs surrounding housing, child care, and other benefits for members of the Armed Forces and their families.That includes a $2.9 billion increase in the Basic Allowance for Housing and $590 million to help with temporary housing allowances for service members, to help with relocation.It also includes more funding for the military health care system.The expanded benefits could incentivize more people, especially with spouses and children, to join the armed services.

Outperforming every alt like crazy, 200k this year isnt impossible I believe, the momentum really is there this time around, with all the institutions as well which wasn't there in the past bullruns.

reddit,s,"WARNING: ChangeNOW has been holding my funds hostage for over 2.5 months. Here is the full, unedited support chat log.","I made a Pro Exchange on ChangeNOW on May 4th, because I'm an idiot, and had always had good experiences with their non-custodial version. I swapped something for \~1 TAO (worth about $400 at the time), which then never appeared in my account. This is the complete log of my conversation with their support team since then. Only my personal information and their AI bot's messages have been removed.

I'm not sure what else I can do at this point, other than warn people to steer clear. If anyone has any advice on what I can do to get my money back, I'd love to hear it.

----

**May 8**

**Me:** I need more help. I need to inquire about the status of a Pro Exchange I made to TAO which I haven't been able to access for days.

**Me:** Exchange Pro ID: `[REDACTED_TX_ID]`

**Me:** The TAO seems to be inaccessible to me. I talked to support and they said they were working on it, but that was four days ago. If it's not getting fixed shortly, can I just get it reverted/refunded to something else?

**Anthony:** Thank you for providing the details. I am reviewing the issue - please give me a moment.

**Anthony:** Our team is still working on this case. At the moment, we don‚Äôt have any updates we can share with you.

**Me:** Can you simply refund it or send it on to an external address?

**Anthony:** In that case, we‚Äôre already working on processing the refund of your balance. Unfortunately, implementing the fix is taking some time.

**Me:** Okay... hours, days, weeks? I need to have some idea what to expect.

**Anthony:** I‚Äôve requested an ETA from the team and will get back to you as soon as I receive it.

**Me:** Okay, thank you.

----

**May 12**

**Me:** I'd like an update on the status of my TAO exchange, or a refund. It's been a week now. (TX id: `[REDACTED_TX_ID]`)

**Tim:** Hi, checking.

**Tim:** Unfortunately, we have not finished fixing the issue as of yet, we deeply apologize for the prolonged wait and the inconvenience caused. We completely understand that a week for this case is unacceptable. Your funds are completely safe. We will keep you updated.

**Me:** You can't even tell me if it'll be today or a month from now? I need something, here.

**Tim:** We have not received a fixed ETA for the fix yet. I am currently checking with our team for more specific information. Our team has let us know that they will provide us with the update either today or tomorrow. The issue will most likely be fixed in the following week. Again, we deeply apologize for the wait. We will contact you via this chat or e-mail once there is an update.

**Me:** Okay, good to hear, thank you.

**Tim:** Thank you for reaching out as well. We will do our best to fix the issue.

----

**May 19**

**Me:** This is me checking in a week later. I haven't heard anything and still don't see my TAO from exchange ID `[REDACTED_TX_ID]`.

**Alejandro:** Hi! Checking! No updates as of yet, sir/madam. Thank you lots for addressing us, we kindly ask you to wait a bit.

**Me:** I've been waiting for two weeks now. A week ago, they said they would have the update that day or the next, and it would most likely be fixed by now. I'm trying to be reasonable and patient, but at some point I'm going to have to start complaining loudly about this and hope it gets you guys to fix this. There's no way it should be taking this long for a simple fix or refund. Could someone explain to me the exact nature of the problem? Either the money is lost, in which case I should get a refund, or it's not, in which case it shouldn't be a challenge for one of your tech guys to forward the coins out of the address.

**Alejandro:** Checking with the team once again, one moment, please.

**Me:** Thank you.

**Alejandro:** The nature of the issue is that TAO is not supported at the moment but we'll find the resolution. Waiting for an update, one moment, please, we'll notify you.

**Me:** With Exchange Pro, you guys have custody of the money during the transfer. That means you have the TAO. Can't you simply send me its equivalent in ETH or BTC or whatever, and then you're welcome to take as long as you want working out the TAO problem?

**Alejandro:** ETA is the next week, sir/madam. It'll be done! Rest assured.

**Me:** Yes, you said that last week. What is the problem with what I suggested? You have the TAO. You're having problems with it. Just send me its value in some other coin, and keep it for yourself.

**Alejandro:** There are technical nuances that would be a problem. Our team will resolve this situation and you'll be notified as soon as it's done.

**Me:** Okay, but if it's still not done a week from now, I am going to start complaining loudly on forums and all that crap. Hopefully it won't come to that. Thanks, have a good day.

**Alejandro:** We assure you that the issue will be resolved, sir. It just needs a bit of waiting. Thank you so much for your patience, we sincerely appreciate it. Have a good one and keep in touch please.

----

**May 27**

**Me:** It's been yet another week. I hope this is resolved?

**Kate:** Hello! Could you please give a brief description of the issue?

**Me:** I've been waiting three weeks on my TAO from pro tx: `[REDACTED_TX_ID]`. (See earlier conversation.)

**Kate:** That's odd. According to our records, the conversion with the ID `[REDACTED_TX_ID]` has finished, the TAO should be in your account.

**Me:** Am I talking to an actual person? See the previous discussion with three other agents regarding this transaction. The TAO disappeared.

**Kate:** My apologies, let me check again. Our development team provided a new ETA - they said the issue is being worked on and should be resolved within this week. I'm very sorry for this inconvenience.

**Me:** You've been saying that every time since the first day. Again, since they are the ones that have the TAO, can they simply keep that and manually refund me the equivalent so that I can get this taken care of?

**Kate:** I will try to forward that request to our team, but since it's outside standard procedure, it will be most likely denied.

**Me:** Please do forward that request. Can you at the very least give me a firm ETA? You said it will be finished this week, so I will be able to get my money out by Friday? How about if not, they do a manual refund? I feel I have been reasonable, but this is getting ridiculous.

**Kate:** I'm sorry, but I'm working with the information that is being provided to me by our development team. They gave me an ETA of ""Within this week"". That's all I can say, unfortunately.

**Me:** Please pass along my request that they either ACTUALLY get it done this time, or go ahead and manually refund me. Thank you.

----

**June 14**

**Me:** It's a month and a half now and I've heard nothing and I *still* see no TAO from my pro tx `[REDACTED_TX_ID]`. This is totally unacceptable. What's the deal?

**Benjamin:** Hello, let me check. My apologise for delay. Still checking information. We apologise. I forwarded it over to the technical team, they are dealing with this issue. Please contact us with in next 2 days if your problem is not solved.

**Me:** It's been a month and a half. Every time I check in, I've been told it'll be fixed or I'll have an update within a day or two. What happens in 2 days when it's still not fixed, because I promise you it won't be. Just send me a simple goddamned refund or manually send it out, already, this is nuts.

**Benjamin:** We are very sorry that this is causing so much inconvenience. I've told the team to take care of your issue first.

**Me:** They've had a month and a half to take care of the issue. You have ownership of the coins, so just send me the equivalent, and then you can take as long as you want to fix your buggy code. Otherwise I'm out of ideas, and I'll post this on Reddit and hope somebody out there can help, or at least give you some bad press.

**Benjamin:** Your issue is being processed. We apologise for the long wait. Please contact us in 2 days if the problem is not resolved.

**Me:** And if it isn't resolved?

**Benjamin:** We will do our best to resolve this issue.

**Me:** So if it isn't resolved, you'll ask me to wait another two days. Do you have a supervisor or someone I can talk to? This should not be so fucking hard, and I'm out of patience.

**Benjamin:** My apologise for delay. Our tech team process this issue. Could you please provide me with your email to contact with you? Our tech team will be able to solve the problem by 07:00 a.m. (UTC). At which time we will write to you by mail as you will need a conversion from your side, which we will request manually and you will receive your funds.

**Me:** `[REDACTED_EMAIL]`

**Benjamin:** Thank you, we will write you.

**Me:** I'll be expecting it.

**Benjamin:** Thank you for understanding.

----

**June 18**

**Me:** It's been another few days, and I never got an email. Let me know if the problem's fixed now, or if we can go ahead with the refund.

**Anthony:** I‚Äôve requested an update from the technical team regarding the resolution of your case and will get back to you as soon as I receive it. The team is currently exploring ways to convert your TAO token into another asset, which would allow you to withdraw your funds ‚Äî even if in a different form. We‚Äôre actively working on this solution, and I‚Äôll let you know as soon as there‚Äôs any progress.

**Me:** Good to hear, anything I can exchange would be just fine by me. So later today, or what?

**Anthony:** I expect to receive an update within 1‚Äì2 hours and will reach out to you to coordinate the next steps or inform you of any further developments.

**Me:** Excellent.

*(2 hours later)*

**Anthony:** I'm sorry to inform you, but unfortunately, it will not be possible to resolve this task within the next 24 hours, as much as we would like to. At the moment, the team has attempted to perform the required conversion, but the system is refusing to process it. To fix the issue, we will either need to integrate a patch or explore an alternative workaround. I have escalated the issue as far as currently possible, and the team will work even harder on this than before. I sincerely apologize, and we are aiming to resolve this matter by next Monday, June 23, or to propose another viable solution by then.

**Me:** Can you just agree that someone will just manually send me the equivalent coinage by then, if you haven't fixed the problem?

**Tony:** We will resolve the issue in any case - it‚Äôs only a matter of time. For now, we‚Äôre sticking to the previously mentioned timeframes, and moving forward, everything will be handled in accordance with our standard policies, without exceptions.

**Anthony:** –°ompensation is an option. We are also considering it as a possible solution to the issue, but we will proceed with it only if we are unable to implement another resolution.

----

**June 29**

**Me:** Well, it's been another two weeks. Is it fixed, or can I kindly get my compensation now?

**Tony:** Hello! Could you please clarify in more detail what your question is about, so I can assist you more accurately? I see the previous chats; I will review them now.

**Me:** See previous conversation. In short: pro transaction `[REDACTED_TX_ID]`, I never got my TAO from it, and it was two months ago.

**Tony:** I have requested the information and will get back to you once we receive a response.

*(Later, a different agent responds)*

**Benjamin:** Hello, our tech team still working of this issue. We will contact with you within next 12 hours. Thank you for understanding.

**Me:** Yeah, I'll be holding my breath.

**Benjamin:** Thank you.

----

**June 30**

**Me:** It's been 12 hours, and I've not been contacted.

**Anthony:** Unfortunately, no update has been received by our team member within the past 12 hours. I‚Äôll check the status of your case now. Great news! The technical team responsible for the issue has confirmed that a fix has been implemented to prevent such situations from happening again. They are now continuing to work on resolving the active cases to return funds to affected users. We‚Äôre currently awaiting an update.

**Me:** And when should I expect to hear about that?

**Anthony:** I‚Äôve requested information regarding this matter and will get back to you with an update shortly. I haven‚Äôt received a specific ETA yet, but work is actively ongoing, so I‚Äôm hopeful we‚Äôll get one within the next few hours.

**Me:** Okay, thanks.

**July 1**

**Me:** Well, it's been a few hours.

**Alejandro:** We'll notify you as soon as we get an update, sir/madam. I assure you that the process is being done by our team.

----

**July 7**

**Me:** It's been another week.

**Tim:** Hi, checking.

**Tessa:** Hi! Unfortunately there is no update at the moment. We deeply apologize for the inconvenience caused. Our team is still working on it.

----

**July 10**

**Me:** Get me a human. And is my refund ready?

**Alejandro:** Hi, sir/madam, unfortunately, no updates as of yet. Our team needs a bit more time to figure out the issue.

**Me:** And now?

**Alejandro:** Sir/madam, it'll take some time for sure. Please wait for an update from us.

**Me:** I have been waiting for two and a half months. Please put me on with your supervisor.

**Alejandro:** Sir/madam, I'm here to help and guide you. You will be notified about any updates.

*Full disclosure: At this point I decide to explain the situation to ChatGPT, and have it advise on how to move forward, since I was getting nowhere.*

**Me:**

>Pro‚ÄØExchange‚ÄØID‚ÄØ`[REDACTED_TX_ID]` has been outstanding since‚ÄØ4‚ÄØMay‚Äî75‚ÄØdays without delivery.

**Alejandro:** Sir/madam, we understand your frustration and deeply apologise that it takes longer that you might have expected but such cases are complicated and require thorough viewing. We're kindly asking for your patience and understanding. Please, wait for an update from us.

**Me:** Acknowledgement noted, but a generic apology does not answer my request.

>**Action items (no later than 17:00‚ÄØUTC‚ÄØ18‚ÄØJuly):** 1.‚ÄØConfirm you have escalated this to a senior supervisor and provide their name, title, direct email, and your internal ticket/incident ID. 2.‚ÄØGive me a firm ETA in hours for one of the two outcomes already outlined: ‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢ TAO sent to `[REDACTED_TAO_WALLET]`, or ‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢ USDT/USDC/BTC/ETH refund to `[REDACTED_ETH_WALLET]`.

**Alejandro:** Sir/madam, every single piece of information is forwarded. We cannot proceed with a refund unless the investigation is done and we don't provide such information. Thank you so much for understanding. We're kindly asking you to wait for an update.

**Me:** Alejandro ‚Äî Your refusal to give supervisory contact or even a rough ETA after 75‚ÄØdays is unacceptable and violates basic consumer‚Äëprotection standards. This is my final notice before formal escalation.

>‚Ä¢ Today, I will file complaints with FinCEN, the relevant Attorney General, and the Saint‚ÄØVincent‚ÄØ&‚ÄØthe‚ÄØGrenadines FSA, and I will publish this entire chat log on Reddit, X/Twitter, and Trustpilot. ‚Ä¢ You have 4‚ÄØhours from the timestamp of this message to prevent that by providing ONE of the following with a verifiable TX‚ÄëID: ‚ÄÉ1) Full TAO transfer to `[REDACTED_TAO_WALLET]`, or ‚ÄÉ2) Refund in USDT/USDC/BTC/ETH to `[REDACTED_ETH_WALLET]`.

**Alejandro:** Sir/madam, I promise you that our team is working on your request and we'll get to you with an update once we have one. Checking with the team, one moment.

**Me:** Alejandro‚Äîthanks for checking. I‚Äôll wait 30‚ÄØminutes for your concrete update. If I have neither a TX‚ÄëID nor the supervisor‚Äôs contact by then, I‚Äôll proceed with the formal complaints exactly as outlined.

**Alejandro:** Checked it, sir/madam. Our team is indeed working on resolving this situation but I'm afraid we cannot give ETA here.

**Me:** Alejandro ‚Äî I‚Äôve asked repeatedly for two very simple things‚ÄØ‚Äî‚ÄØ(1) a supervisor‚Äôs contact and‚ÄØ(2) an ETA in hours. You‚Äôve declined both. Per my prior notice, I am now proceeding with formal complaints to FinCEN, the relevant Attorney‚ÄØGeneral, and other regulators, and will publish this chat log publicly. You can still stop that paperwork only by providing, within the next 2‚ÄØhours:

>‚Ä¢ a verifiable TX‚ÄëID for either ‚ÄÉa) the TAO transfer to `[REDACTED_TAO_WALLET]`, or ‚ÄÉb) a refund in USDT/USDC/WBTC/ETH to `[REDACTED_ETH_WALLET]`.

**Alejandro:** Sir/madam,it'll unfortunately take a bit more time for our team to complete your request. Please, kidnly asking you to wait a bit. We promise that it'll be done and you'll be notified about it.

**Me:** I've kindly waited for 75 days. You've got just over an hour left.

**Alejandro:** Sir/madam, please kindly understand, this cannot be done in some hours. We need a nit more time to do a research and understand how to resolve this.

**Me:** YOU'VE HAD TWO AND A HALF MONTH. How you RESOLVE it is sending me MY MONEY. It's not goddamned rocket science.

**Me:** I'm going to go ahead and start posting about this. If I get my money before tomorrow, I'll take them down, but otherwise, I'll go ahead with alerting the regulatory agencies in the morning.",2025-07-14 00:09:43+00:00

Our technology is designed to scale, to be green and sustainable, and to empower real people‚Äînot just speculators.

We help each other. We educate. We innovate. We grow stronger every single day.


And this is just the beginning.

With every milestone, with every new partnership, we get closer to delivering on our mission.

We‚Äôre not just dreaming about the future. We‚Äôre building it.

Look at this community. Look at the potential. Look at the vision.

Fone Network is not just another project‚Äîit‚Äôs the future.

A future where opportunity is universal. Where you have the power in your pocket to change your life.

The data also comes ahead of a monetary policy decision by the country‚Äôs central bank later in July.Singapore‚Äôs economy grew at 1.4% in the second quarter of 2025, avoiding a technical recession as it reversed the 0.5% contraction recorded in the first three months of the year.On a year-over-year basis, the country‚Äôs economy expanded 4.3% year-over-year in the second quarter of 2025, accelerating from 4.1% in the first three months and beating expectations. A Reuters poll of economists had forecast a 3.5% growth.A technical recession is commonly defined as two consecutive quarter-over-quarter declines in a country‚Äôs GDP. Analysts polled by Reuters had estimated a 0.6% quarter-over-quarter growth.The GDP growth was led by the manufacturing sector, which expanded 5.5% year over year, up from 4.4% in the first quarter of 2025. The sector makes up about 17% of the country‚Äôs economy.Despite the GDP beat, Singapore‚Äôs Ministry of Trade and Industry said in its release that ‚Äúthere remains significant uncertainty and downside risks in the global economy in the second half of 2025 given the lack of clarity over the tariff policies of the U.S.‚ÄùBack in April, MTI had downgraded the country‚Äôs GDP growth to 0%-2%, down from its previous forecast of 1%-3%. Singapore recorded a full-year GDP growth figure of 4.4% in 2024.Unlike other countries in Southeast Asia that have been hit with ‚Äútariff letters,‚Äù Singapore has not received such a ‚Äúletter‚Äù from U.S. President Donald Trump. However, Singapore still faces the baseline 10% tariff from the U.S., despite running a trade deficit with the U.S. and having a free trade agreement since 2004.Singapore‚Äôs economic resilience task force, set up in April in response to the U.S. tariffs, announced last week that it will roll out grants to help businesses cope with the impact of global trade tensions.The GDP release also comes ahead of a monetary policy decision by the country‚Äôs central bank later in July.In its May meeting, the Monetary Authority of Singapore loosened its policy for a second straight time, saying that ‚Äúthere are downside risks to Singapore‚Äôs economic outlook stemming from episodes of financial market volatility and a sharper-than-expected fall in final demand abroad.‚ÄùThe MAS also warned that a more abrupt or persistent weakening in global trade will have a significant impact on Singapore‚Äôs trade-related sectors and, in turn, the broader economy.Nonetheless, the country‚Äôs inflation numbers are supportive of a rate cut.Singapore‚Äôs headline inflation rate fell to 0.8% in May, its lowest level since February 2021, while core inflation, which excludes accommodation and private transport, came in at 0.6% in May, compared to 0.7% the month before.",2025-07-13 17:10:04+00:00

banknews,dai,CNBC Daily Open: Surprise tariff salvo on Saturday,"Singapore‚Äôs economy grew at 1.4% quarter on quarter in the second quarter of 2025, a reversal from the 0.5% contraction seen in the first quarter The GDP growth was led by the manufacturing sector, which expanded 5.5% year over year. The data also comes ahead of a monetary policy decision by the country‚Äôs central bank later in July.Singapore‚Äôs economy grew at 1.4% in the second quarter of 2025, avoiding a technical recession as it reversed the 0.5% contraction recorded in the first three months of the year.On a year-over-year basis, the country‚Äôs economy expanded 4.3% year-over-year in the second quarter of 2025, accelerating from 4.1% in the first three months and beating expectations. A Reuters poll of economists had forecast a 3.5% growth.A technical recession is commonly defined as two consecutive quarter-over-quarter declines in a country‚Äôs GDP. Analysts polled by Reuters had estimated a 0.6% quarter-over-quarter growth.The GDP growth was led by the manufacturing sector, which expanded 5.5% year over year, up from 4.4% in the first quarter of 2025. The sector makes up about 17% of the country‚Äôs economy.Despite the GDP beat, Singapore‚Äôs Ministry of Trade and Industry said in its release that ‚Äúthere remains significant uncertainty and downside risks in the global economy in the second half of 2025 given the lack of clarity over the tariff policies of the U.S.‚ÄùBack in April, MTI had downgraded the country‚Äôs GDP growth to 0%-2%, down from its previous forecast of 1%-3%. Singapore recorded a full-year GDP growth figure of 4.4% in 2024.Unlike other countries in Southeast Asia that have been hit with ‚Äútariff letters,‚Äù Singapore has not received such a ‚Äúletter‚Äù from U.S. President Donald Trump. However, Singapore still faces the baseline 10% tariff from the U.S., despite running a trade deficit with the U.S. and having a free trade agreement since 2004.Singapore‚Äôs economic resilience task force, set up in April in response to the U.S. tariffs, announced last week that it will roll out grants to help businesses cope with the impact of global trade tensions.The GDP release also comes ahead of a monetary policy decision by the country‚Äôs central bank later in July.In its May meeting, the Monetary Authority of Singapore loosened its policy for a second straight time, saying that ‚Äúthere are downside risks to Singapore‚Äôs economic outlook stemming from episodes of financial market volatility and a sharper-than-expected fall in final demand abroad.‚ÄùThe MAS also warned that a more abrupt or persistent weakening in global trade will have a significant impact on Singapore‚Äôs trade-related sectors and, in turn, the broader economy.Nonetheless, the country‚Äôs inflation numbers are supportive of a rate cut.Singapore‚Äôs headline inflation rate fell to 0.8% in May, its lowest level since February 2021, while core inflation, which excludes accommodation and private transport, came in at 0.6% in May, compared to 0.7% the month before.",2025-07-13 18:05:35+00:00

banknews,near,Dow futures drop nearly 200 points after Trump slaps 30% tariff on Mexico and the EU: Live updates,"U.S. equity futures slid on Sunday evening as Wall Street contends with continued tariff risks and second-quarter earnings on deck.S&P 500 futures lost 0.4%, while Nasdaq 100 futures dropped 0.5%. Futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 183 points, or 0.4%.On Saturday, President Donald Trump said the U.S. will impose 30% tariffs on the European Union and Mexico starting Aug. 1. Leaders of the EU and Mexico indicated that they intend to keep talking with the Trump administration this month in an attempt to agree on a lower rate.The announcement comes ahead of inflation readings this week, which will give investors a better sense of how the Trump tariffs already in effect are being felt throughout the economy.‚ÄúInflation is here with tariffs. It‚Äôs just a question of who eats it. Those companies that have pricing power means that consumers are going to eat it. Those companies that don‚Äôt have pricing power means that companies are going to eat it via a cut in their profit margin,‚Äù Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Financial Group, said Friday on CNBC‚Äôs ‚ÄúFast Money.‚ÄùSunday‚Äôs move in futures comes after a negative week for stocks, although the major averages are still near record highs. The S&P 500 dipped 0.31%, its first negative week in three. The Dow fell 1.02%, breaking a three-week win streak.Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite inched down 0.08%, snapping a three-week winning streak.Earnings season is set to ramp up later in the week. Major banks, including JPMorgan Chase, will deliver quarterly reports starting Tuesday.Another potential factor for investors to monitor is the rift between the Trump administration and the Federal Reserve. On Sunday, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett told ABC News that President Trump can fire Fed Chair Jerome Powell ‚Äúif there‚Äôs cause.‚ÄùTrump officials are probing the costs of renovation of the Federal Reserve‚Äôs main building in Washington, D.C., while the president has repeatedly criticized Powell for not lowering interest rates. The central bank has pushed back against some of the criticisms of the renovation project.S&P 500, Nasdaq Composite with 0.5% of record highsHere is how the major averages performed last week and where they sit in terms of their record highs:The S&P 500 fell -0.31% for its first negative week in 3 The index is -0.48% off its record high The Nasdaq Composite fell -0.08%, breaking a three-week win streakThe index is 0.34% off its record high The Dow fell -1.02%, snapping a three-week win streakThe average is 1.56% off its record high. ‚Äî Jesse Pound, Christopher HayesTrump says Mexico, EU will face 30% tariff on Aug. 1Jonathan Ernst | ReutersU.S. President Donald Trump speaks to reporters as he departs for travel to Texas to tour areas affected by deadly flash flooding, from the South Lawn of the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., July 11, 2025. President Donald Trump on Saturday said that Mexico and the European Union will face a 30% tariff rating starting Aug. 1. This continues the trend of Trump releasing letters announcing tariff rates unilaterally, and hits two of the United States‚Äô biggest trading partners.Leaders of both Mexico and the EU indicated that they plan to continue talking to the Trump administration ahead of Aug. 1 and are looking for a lower rate. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said Sunday the EU would delay its own tariffs, which were set to take effect on Monday, the Associated Press reported.‚Äî Jesse Pound, Erin DohertyStock market futures open lowerEquity futures were lower when trading resumed on Sunday evening in New York.

The coin has good art, website, and even an AI bot in a dedicated chat space.  Some people have said to just launch a new coin, but that seems scammy to me.  I believe in this one and there are still some big wallet holders who believe in the narrative and I don't want to screw them over.
